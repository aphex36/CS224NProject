Hubby had the blackened shrimp  salad and loved so much so on our 2nd visit he ordered it again.  The 2nd visit for me was a huge let down. I opted for the black bean burger which arrived room temp void of flavor and dry!  The only saving grace was the roasted potatoes I enjoyed the same as the first visit.

My vet - Big Easy (who I love) - recommended an endoscopy, which is a procedure that only PVSEC does.\n\nAt PVSEC, I was presented with an x-ray and told that an endoscopy would be a great way to go.  And -- if unsuccessful, thus necessitating surgery, the fee would go down to a total $250, which would encompass the ancillary costs like the visit, the anesthesia, and the prep work. \n\nThe endoscopy was unsuccessful, and we have to do surgery.  Thankfully, he's not in any immediate danger so we can go to our local vet who was far more reasonable on the cost-front.  That said, upon leaving PVSEC, i was stuck with a bill for $900.\n\nThe vet who gave me the estimate told me she was very clear - \"the words came right out her mouth,\" as she put it - that the endoscopy fee would only go down to $250 if unsuccessful, but that was just the fee for performing the service.  The anesthesia, and ancillary costs, on top of this \"reduced\" endoscopy fee still put my visit to $900.  Tomorrow I'm probably going to spend another $2000. \n\nI'm an attorney - people try to get out of paying me all the time when things don't go the way they want them to.

When I first walked into the place I didn't like how dim it was in the hallways and lounge area, but it really made sense once you left (it was to make it easier for your eyes to adjust).  The food was better than I thought.  Based on the reviews I was expecting it to be garbage.  It wasn't exceptional, but it was pretty tasty.  The portions (from what I could tell) were quite large too.  I had the salad, shrimp with risotto and beans, and the fruit sorbet.  The one complaint about the food was that the risotto wasn't really creamy, it was a bit dry.  \n\nThe negative things I have to say should come with a DISCLAIMER.  I was attended the restaurant for a charity event, so the comments on service may not apply on a regular night.\n\nI found the service to be incredibly slow.  We were supposed to eat at 7pm, but they didn't even start seating people until after 8pm.  After that you still had to wait for everyone to be seating before they would start serving you.  \n\nI thought it was pretty disorganized.  You walk in and have no idea where you're going.  No one was at coat check.  And good thing I looked at the menu online beforehand, because the \"menu\" in the lounge where you pick  your food simply said:  \"beef, shrimp, pasta, chicken\" on a white piece of paper.  You had no idea what they came with or how they were cooked.  You were supposed to tell someone what you were going to be ordering.  That was very unclear, however, and no one was walking around trying to take orders until 7pm when we were supposed to be seated.    \n\nIf you read the review or get tips from people who have been already, I found that the \"surprise\" dishes are always the same.

There are a lot of \"spiritual\" and sometimes off the wall hippies that roams around and dance to their inner spirits. Entertaining but sometimes a little too much, but appreciatively fun!\n\nMy favorite which this review only applies to is....swing dancing! Yes!!  \nBefore, I never experienced swing dancing until one night after getting tired of seeing all of the drum circle chanting and everyone just being so freely spiritual....so we went to the next lounge called the Thunderbird Lounge in the Aruba and there we found awesome 50's music and people swing dancing to the tunes.  \n\nI love to dance but I don't like dancing with others because I don't like to be touched. Watching the swing dancers looked so amazing and fun.  After smiling and watching to a few songs, I noticed an overweight older man in his 60's get up from his table where he sat by himself and walked towards my way.  I was a little petrified, but he respectfully came up to me and was such a gentleman and said, \"Lady, may I have this dance?\" I felt like I was in the 50's and very timid! I told him that I do not know how to swing dance at all. He assured me that it was okay and he will teach me. So, I trusted his sense of kindness, respect and danced with the fellow.\n\nWOW!!! I had one of the best times of my life dancing. He taught me and I just went with it. I messed up a little but it was so fun and although there was physical contact; I did not feel uncomfortable or groped at all which was great! It was pure dancing in a non sexual way and all in fun! Then, people would switch partners in the midst of the song which was really interesting! Again, none of the gentlemen that I danced with that night made me feel uncomfortable at all.\n\nThe best thing which I have to try is that on Fridays and Sundays at 6pm, they have FREE swing dancing lessons for 2 hours and the rest of the evening is just PURE and FUN swing dancing! I am going to try the lessons and swing dance the night away so I don't step on anyone's feet next time!","date":"2010-04-01 23:26:44"}

Alicia R set this up since she's done the trail plenty of times. Goal was to get at least 6 miles in.  \n\nThe trail is paved and is between a normal sidewalk and the street.  You'll find all walks of life from kids, teens, middle-aged, and seniors in their prime.  Most are jogging, some bikers, and guys like me that choose to walk.  The trail runs a little over 2 miles from Paseo Verde Park to St Rose Parkway.  This means a good 4 miles there and back.  During this quick trek, you'll pass other parks, the Multigenerational Center, and Green Valley Ranch.  \n\nI find trails a lot easier to complete than tracks or side streets.  It also helps to be with a group that's walking or jogging at the same pace with you.  Overall, I don't mind driving 30 minutes from home to get here and knock out 4 miles.  This is a nice quick trail to get some cardio in.  By the way, we did meet our goal of 6 miles by circling a few parks multiple times.  \n\nTIP:  Start your hike, walk, or run at Paseo Verde Park since it's slightly uphill to St. Rose Park.

And porn.\nTo clarify: Eggslut and food porn. \nOnly in Vegas is this punniness so fitting and appropriately inappropriate ^^;\n\nSeeing the long line wrap around the corner, I thought Eggslut would be over-hyped, with most customers comprised of either hipster wannabes with an obsessive love for glass jars, or those in need of brunchy hangover therapy. (On weekends, it even opens at midnight so you can get gourmet breakfast for drunchies!)\n\nDespite the potential for an inflated hype factor, the concept of craft eggs still piqued my curiosity and I decided to check it out... and ended up coming here 2 days in a row.\n\nThe Slut ($10.82 - a coddled egg on top of smooth potato purée, cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette): Their signature. Simple in concept as egg and potatoes in a jar with some bread on the side for good measure; complex in reality with the simplicity of homemade mashed potatoes contrasting the orgasmic runny yolk with a sprinkle of earthy chives. Even the baguette is top-notch, tasting like the crostini of high-end restaurants and drizzled with a dash of olive oil. You're supposed to mix the egg\/potatoes jar and spread it on the baguette, but I also enjoyed eating part of it separately and less mixed to bring out different flavors. It could do with less salt, but it was otherwise layery goodness.\n\nThe Gaucho ($16.22 - seared wagyu tri-tip steak, chimichurri, red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg): The heartiest menu item. The steak is a bit too salty and may be dry with respect to hard-core steak standards, but for slices in my breakfast it was definitely quality. The combination of tri-tip, chimichurri, and red onions rendered a piquant Argentinian flavor profile, and the egg was more of an afterthought. I suggest getting the salad version because the steak pairs well with the nutty arugula dressed in a tangy, citrusy sauce and a sprinkle of shaved parmesan.\n\n*Note that you can substitute the brioche bun with arugula salad for any of their breakfast sandwiches. \n\nService is efficient and friendly, though workers do seem to get chatty amongst themselves. Both times, I waited momentarily in anticipation for my order to be called, after I already saw the food prepared. \n\nI applaud Eggslut's conscientiousness to sustainability (much needed, especially in light of the new climate-change-denying presidential administration... eww). All boxes and utensils are compostable, and Slut glasses are recycled. Slut glasses? Pun not intended :3\n\nThe verdict? Eggcellent! Not your cheapest breakfast, but good value in comparison to the $12 bottled juice and $14 smoothies at Juice Standard next door.","date":"2016-12-09 02:37:05"}

Strike up a conversation with any of your friends, and you will hear them rattle off names, which I can only guess has something to do with being in a capitalist society with brave entrepreneurs competing for a slice of that pizza demand curve amongst a glut of supply. Its not easy to decide when there are so many choices. \n\nHowever, thats why I'm here people. :) I'm going to point you at the lighthouse through all these storm clouds, and that place is in Ahwatukee, and it is called \"JIMMY & JOE'S PIZZERIA\". \n\nAllow me to explain. This place is different than the others. Its not just the fact that the decor and quality of design inside makes for a visually impressive and comfortable experience. Their menu is UNIQUE. Upon my first experience, I came under the pressure of some of my coworkers that dragged me along against my will. Reason being, I was trying to drop a few pounds, and I was averse to stuffing my face with the appetite kryptonite that pizza is to my Regularman. What I found, though, was that I could order a freshly made slice, instead of a personal size or some other portion destined to tempt me to overeat. Simple concept it would seem right? Well, maybe not, because their aren't many places where you can get a slice that is made at JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. There were also combo options, with the drink included, and ways to add a salad and select the toppings you want. Its kinda like Chipotle took off its clothes and became a pizza joint. A compliment I intentionally invoke because of their similarities; and these things are the cleanliness, quality, and ability to customize your order. Well done JIMMY. Well done.\n\nI haven't had their delivery yet, but I do know that they do offer that. Since its my opinion I'm sharing, with the intent that it will persuade you also, I would recommend coming here to eat with friends. Its affordable, spacious, and you can even move the tables around if you have a big group with you. \n\nI will conclude with the BEST thing I like, next to their thin New York style slices, and it is this: \n\nREWARDS!\n\nIf you sign up for their loyalty program, you are rewarded with special offers via text, such as free slices and discounts, which I have thankfully benefited from when money has been scarce. More importantly though, you get the feeling that your business isn't being taken for granted. I like this particularly, and I will continue to rewind my visits, rather than fast forward. :)","date":"2015-02-21 01:24:16"}

Everyone was friendly and organized...the whole process is smoother. The BBQ itself is getting better...the brisket tasted a lot better this time around. They serve it chopped up, so its not easy to see the smoke ring, but the flavor is right up there. \n\nOnly room for improvement would be the sides. I had the BBQ beans and coleslaw. For me...the slaw is all vinegar and not creamy like I like it. Not my style. The beans have a heavy smoke flavor and a bit of spice, while I like them a bit sweeter or with a hint of maple. Just my opinion, doesn't detract from the fact this is a pretty good BBQ spot. \n\nThey do take out, and sell by the pound. Catering also. Enjoy!","date":"2015-12-12 18:34:56"}

The staff at the counter were NOT knowledgable about guns at all. The women that were hired were there to just \"look good\" because when I asked them questions about guns behind the counter, they could not answer them. Ridiculous. Go ahead and hire good looking women, but at least train them on proper knowledge about guns. \n\nAlso, if you're looking for a lot of freedom in this range, this is NOT the place to go. For one, they don't let you touch or feel the guns before shooting. (At American Shooters, they let you feel\/grip the guns all you want so that you can pick out which gun you're comfortable with before shooting). When you get out on the actual range, they don't let you pick and choose how far your target is. It is at a set distance. At other local ranges, you can move the target at the distance that you please. On top of that, you can't use your own ammo here. Nor can you load your own mag!!! When you actually go and shoot, the guy held my hand the whole time on the gun before I shot. I get it- they're trying to be extra safe, but this is mostly a tourist attraction and not a local range to go to every week to practice. \n\nPricing is okay. For regular handguns, it's typically $20 and that includes 20 rounds of ammo. But for bigger guns like the Desert Eagle, it's $20 for only FIVE rounds. \n\nIf you are a local and want to shoot to practice, go to American Shooters or The Range 702. There is much more freedom there. You can take a look at the guns up close and personal before shooting. I find this to be a great advantage because if you're looking to buy a certain gun, you can really inspect it and get a feel for it before making a decision to purchase it. The staff as well are super knowledgable, which is what you really want if you're into guns. As said before, you can adjust how far you want to shoot your target at American Shooters. Last but not least, there is no one out there \"baby-ing\" you on the range. No one is holding your hand the whole time and you can load the magazine by yourself. Great range for practicing and shooting.\n\nIf you are a tourist and a first time shooter, sure the Gun Garage is probably the place for you. But if you are a local, by all means stay away and go to American Shooters.","date":"2015-08-25 05:31:01"}

We were able to get in for free with a promoter and had free lemonade thingys and a seat. BUT before we could get in, we had to wait for something like 300 people to arrive and they let us all in together. As we were walking in I heard someone say \"here comes the ho train\" which I thought was hilarious and probably true.\n\nSeats - God I love sitting down. Especially when in heels. There are lots of seats outside and I guess you can just sit anywhere because I don't think the tables are really assigned or paid for. But this also made me very territorial because I didn't want to lose MY seats to skanky bitches so I felt the need to vehemently guard my area.\n\nOutdoors - I can get kind of claustrophobic in most clubs and I hate hate hate it when sweaty people brush up against me. Since it's Vegas in July it was still pretty hot outside, but at least there was somewhat fresh air and more room to maneuver. I was just reeeaally tempted to try and push strangers in the pool though.\n\nCONs:\nSetup - Yes the outdoor area is cool, but I feel like the setup just wasn't that conducive to mingling. Like me, most people were lounging (or perhaps guarding??) on their seats with friends and not moving much. I guess having a lot of seating is nice for your feet, but doesn't promote socializing. There was a dance floor inside, but I don't think there was that much dancing going on outside. \n\nMusic - Don't you hate it when you're like \"oh I LOVE this song!\" then the DJ changes it 2 second later? Well that happened all night long because the DJ only played like 2 seconds of every song. Maybe this was a way of getting around copy write royalties, I don't know, but it was hella annoying.

Well that opportunity happened when I was going in town and Saturday was the only day they had off.\n\nMy friends drove down from Camp Verde, picked me up from my Grandma's in Sun City and we embarked on Downtown Glendale. I hadn't been to this part of Glendale since I was still living in Phoenix almost 10 years ago now. It was crowded in the whole area when we arrived and at first I thought maybe it was the Farmer's Market, but then realized this was early February and this meant we were stuck in the Chocolate Fair crowd (also meaning not the best time to go to a place for lunch that had been on TV). Since I was technically on \"vacation\", waiting to eat at a place my friends were so excited about meant I could relax, but what was irritating is that the \"hostess\" advised to all who put their name down to stay within the direct vicinity of the restaurant as the entire party had to be together. It was a cold and windy afternoon and there was no waiting allowed inside. I did a quick peruse of the surrounding businesses and it seemed as if very few if any had changed. There are still a ton of antique stores, Haus (whatever the German restaurant that was also featured on DDD and other restaurants. It was actually nice to see the old timey feel was still in the neighborhood. After about a good 35 minute wait, we were shown in to our table. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small and it seemed as if the menu and service was going to be impressive. We all decided to try a couple of salads and a couple of pizzas. They chose one of each as did I. My girlfriend had a glass of Reisling and her husband had his 3rd choice of beer (they were out of the first two choices). I had icd tea and after asking twice for \"fake sugar\", pulled out my own Grandma stash. It wasn't until someone other than our server came around to refill my tea that Splenda was brought. Long time ago, I was a waitress so this alone tends to piss me off -hence mark off for customer service.\n \nThe salads ordered were the spinach and caprese. The spinach salad was pretty good but should have been tossed. The caprese was sad. Really really sad. We all know that February is not tomato season, but under ripe beefsteak tomatoes cannot be saved even with house made mozzerrella. For a \"foodie\" restaurant, this should not have been on the menu at all given the season. \n\nThe pizza's ordered were the Bianca and the Italian Stallion. I have been to Italy. I have had pizza in numerous places with ovens like these and though it was good, I was not blown away (sadly either were my friends). The Bianca was very mild in flavor and benefited from a splash of balsamic. The outer crust was good but the rest of the pizza was soggy on both-either because it needed to cook a bit longer or because something topping wise was too wet. Our server was friendly taking our order but we never saw her again until the end when she asked if we wanted dessert. \n\nI loved spending time with my friends, wished the food was a bit more exciting and super happy that little old Downtown Glendale is popping!","date":"2013-03-02 21:16:12"}

Yes and yes. I rarely review places like this but I had such a fantastic experience that I needed to let the Yelperverse know about it. This is an old school Wendy's, meaning it's not fancy, it's pretty worn down and worn out, and it's in a not-so-nice part of town. So imagine my surprise when I came here and not only was it spotlessly clean (two employees were constantly wiping down tables), it was packed with obvious regulars (lots of old timers and a chatty fellow in line behind us who informed us as such). \n\nIt's clear that many of the employees here are \"lifers,\" meaning they always have and \/ or always will work for Wendy's. That means they are super efficient and true superstars of the fast food chain. The older lady took our order (we had lots of substitutions) with zero issues and got it 100% correct the first time. \n\nWhen our food arrived, we were both shocked. This was hands down the best Wendy's food we'd had in a long, long time. The burgers were hot and fresh and perfectly seasoned, the buns were fluffy, the cheese was melting and gooey, and the produce was so high quality that if you didn't know better you'd guess it was from a higher end burger restaurant. The lettuce was crisp and not brown nor wilted, the pickles were perfect, and my super red and ripe tomatoes were sliced uniformly. I can't say enough about how great this burger was. \n\nIt's fine, but there were several homeless people (and one mentally ill man) hanging out in the parking lot in broad daylight (at 1:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon). They didn't intend to harm anyone, but one of them came inside and started walking around and talking to random customers, disappearing into the restroom (he never came back out before I left and the employees didn't ask him to leave). For that, I had to dock them one star. People were freaking out and feeling uncomfortable, so I would recommend this location get some better security or manager training so they can better deal with situations like this. \n\nFor obvious reasons, I'd suggest you use the drive thru window instead of choosing to dine in.

But now that I've said bon voyage to Kohl's, I feel it's finally safe for me to write a review! \n\nSo, I'm not a shopper. I only go clothes shopping out of pure desperation. I just don't have the patience for it. But when I do shop, I love a good deal! With Kohl's generous coupon policy and constant sales, you can get deals galore. Here's how:\n\n1) You can \"stack\" coupons to save more $$$. Example: You can use a 15% shopping pass, $10 offer when you spend $30 (usually arrives on a sticky in the newspaper), and any Kohl's cash you might have on hand. *The policy is that you can only use ONE percent off offer but can use all other dollar off coupons provided that they are different from one another and you meet the requirements of each coupon. Did I mention there are NO restrictions on using coupons on sale & clearance products??\n\n2) Kohl's Cash is awesome. Earn $10 in Kohl's Cash for every $50 pre-tax you spend. Pay attention to ads - Kohl's cash isn't offered all the time, so don't expect it. \n\n3) Only shop at Kohl's when there is an actual SALE. As in 1 or 2 Day Sales, Power Hours, or Bonus Buy events. Otherwise, you just won't get that great of a deal. Better to tide your time like an evil genius....\n\n4) Sign up for the Kohl's card. Members get extra discounts throughout the year and only cardholders get that awesome 30% off coupon that comes in the mail once in a while. And yes I have a Kohl's card. They got me!!\n\n5) Sign up for the new free Rewards Program. For every 100 points you rack up, you get a $5 off coupon. Associates can look up your loyalty info by your phone number if you don't have a card handy.  \n\nAs if that wasn't incentive enough to shop at Kohl's, you have to admire their return policy. It's as generous as Wal-Mart's, maybe even more so! Man, I could tell you some stories about what Kohl's Associates have returned at Customer Service...But I digress. I shop at Kohl's because of the discounts and the fact that it's pretty much a one-stop shop for clothing.

Curl by curl--to bring out the curl, and the bounce, and the volume that my hair needs.\n\nNow, I've gotta be honest and say that Kandy didn't know how to style my hair as well as I do, but in my experience, not many stylists do. Here's how Kandy is different-- she admitted that and she told me to come back in a week with my hair styled as normal and she'd tweak it.\n\nSo I went back this past Friday and she saw where my hair was too heavy and could use some more shape and she did her scissor magic. (No, she didn't charge me for this value added service).\n\nI looooove my hair. Love it!! I can't tell you the last time that I felt that way. LOVE.

Not a great experience, service took too long, and server did not go the extra mile to assure we were 100% satisfied. Won't be coming here with our friends again.","date":"2013-11-02 21:14:49"}

While the city has come far in the culinary scene, I always thought their Asian presence was lacking when you compare it to other comparable cities. Having a night market will do a lot to improve on that, and after their first season this past year, I think they're on the right track.\n\nThe main thing I wanted to see was something new, or at least legit street food. Something not like the Cleveland Asian Festival, where restaurants precooked their normal food, put them over burners, and served them in tiny bowls while charging a ridiculous price for it. Like if I wanted that, I would go to your restaurant and get more bang for my buck. Some restaurants did just that, served up plain food like fucking fried rice, which I get, it is good and people will buy it, but other restaurants had the right idea and introduced things they don't normally serve. Legit street food, cooked on the spot. Curry fish ball skewers for example. \n\nIt also opened the door for startups to bring something completely new to the table, like the vendor that was serving onigiri and freshly made takoyaki (something I always wanted to do but never had the balls to follow through with). THAT is legit street food and before then was unheard of in Cleveland.\n\nThey also have plenty of non-food related vendors, as well as music and entertainment. Don't forget the very cool yet somewhat creepy performers seemingly floating through the aisles at random times.\n\nAll in all it is a great time with good food. Summer fun at its finest. They're only going to grow from here.\n\nProtip: if you don't want to pay for parking, there is plenty of free street parking a block or two away. Or pay for parking.

The boyfriend got a ham and cheese omlette and about 15 minutes later, two giant plates arrived before us. Each omlette must have been made with at least 5 eggs and there were about 2 potatoes worth of hashbrowns. My omlette was delicious and there were tons of vegetables and some provolone cheese melted in the centre, with feta on top.

For $12 per meal, that's an awesome deal.\n\nI would have to say that the perfect ending to our meal was a party of 3 who came and sat across from us.

The wife of the chef is the waitress and she's warm and friendly!\n\nHere's what we have and recommend.  By the way, they have 150 menu items and we said we'll try them all, eventually.  \n\nWine chicken soup:  Oooooh, just like how my mom used to make.  This is so amazing.  The flavors in each of their dishes is so delish!\n\nBak Kut Teh- Chinese Herbal soup.

Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up. They are not simply a OTB or pool hall... they are much much more.\n\n~Fud\/Drink~\nAs stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood\/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one. \n\n~Atmosphere\/Service~\nOnce again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means \"nice\", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.\n\n~Extras\/Rating~\nCall ahead for specials that day\/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately. Look online, there are numerous coupons available from different spots... I use Entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm! They aren't the finest bar in town, that's understood.

It  was delivered with an awesome chili flavored salsa, as well as, a borderline spicy tomatillo sauce. Both tasted great. \n\nI had the beef tacos of lunch. There were 3 on the plate and they are a bit on the diminutive side, but boy they pack a flavor punch. If I recall correctly, the meat was filet mignon and the sauce it was in was out of this world. It was also topped off with a smoked flavor chili pepper mayo and a fresh grilled green onion in the middle. I could eat 10 of those. \n\nMy wife had the pork enchiladas. She begrudgingly gave me a single bite to taste as they were so good she didn't want to give em up. And I tasted why as they too were awesome. The stewed pork was very flavorful, and the sauces melded perfectly with flavor\n\nOh yea! Try the Sangria...it was so spectacular. Served up by the bartender Elitza. Later i watched her make a house margarita all from scratch with fresh juices and wish I had ordered one of those too. She said their margs are all hand crafted with freshly squeezed juices.

So we attacked the buffet looking to try a little of everything.\n\nThe item that stands out the most to me was the Yucca Root.  While it wasn't the best tasting thing on the tray, it was the most surprising thing.  I did not think it would be nearly as good as it was but it was amazing.  I even had a second helping.  I am a big pork fan and theirs was excellent.  The beef and chicken dishes were great too.  I had a bowl of the traditional Cuban soup (whatever it was called) and loved it.  Great food.\n\nThe dessert tray didn't look that great so we decided to try the \"Best Flan' as voted by PHX New Times.\"  I am not a flan fan, at all, but we were feeling adventurous so we gave it a shot.  It was pretty good.  I'm not sure if it was great...the texture is too much for me...but I enjoyed the taste of it.  If you like flan, give it a try, I guess.\n\nThe place is a bit dingy and feels like an abandoned \"Mariscos\"-type place.  They did have baseball on so I couldn't complain about the entertainment.  The waitress was good but I can see her being overwhelmed if the place was packed.  \n\nI will be back, without a doubt.

I did not love the carbonara sauce. It just wasn't the creamy carbonara I was expecting. But after evaluating the quality of the meal overall, I'm happy to give up the five stars.\n\nPasta Fresh is aptly named. Their open kitchen design allows you to watch everything that goes on and you can see the owner and chef rolling your pasta, well, fresh. The basis of their menu appears to be the build-your-own pasta deal. Pick your pasta, a sauce, a cheese, and your toppings. For my first time, I decided to go that route.\n\nYou don't see pappardelle on menus too often, so I went with that along with the carbonara (sauce), bocconcini (cheese), and spinach and roasted garlic (toppings). The pappardelle was incredible. It definitely made a difference that it was made fresh. In a way, having a lighter sauce helped me fully appreciate the delicate nature of the pasta.\n\nI also tried my friends' dishes. One had spinach ravioli in marinara sauce with zucchini and mushrooms. The other had rigatoni in pesto sauce. Both were tasty, but I especially enjoyed the marinara sauce. I ended up getting some pappardelle with marinara sauce to go for the girlfriend.\n\nWith fresh pasta and fresh ingredients, you get a gourmet meal at reasonable prices. A good deal is the meal for two. For $19.99, you get two build-your-own pasta bowls and a choice of macarons or garlic knots. We got to try both and they get the thumbs up from me. As someone who doesn't even like macarons, it says a lot that I loved their salted caramel.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've gobbled up my leftovers from last night (the word pappardelle comes from pappare which means to gobble up), Pasta Fresh most definitely deserves five stars. I'm still reeling from the absolute deliciousness.","date":"2013-09-10 19:18:06"}

Which of course as you know...makes Rex nothing else. One thing Rex loves is when old friends meet new friends.  Old Friend, sleeping off a bleach\/ammonia high in a dumpster...meet New Friend...waking in the dumpster and finding an unused Groupon coupon. The sun was hot. The dumpster, or as I calling my \"mobile home\", was even hotter. The bad thing about \"mobile homes\" is that they are dirty, lumpy and usually smell like Kirstie Alley's bellybutton. The good thing is that sometimes you can meet someone and have a little...rendezvous. Guys...and I guess girls...if you meet a girl in a dumpster...there is a very good chance she is dead or easy...or both. Sometimes you might be tempted to hang in there if you realize that you are sharing it with a hooker who has a hacking cough. Don't. There are plenty of \"mobile homes\" out there.  TB and an empty wallet sucks.\n\nSo obviously some rich bastard who has things like a home, indoor plumbing and a vacuum that will vacuum the floors on its own just through out this little piece of gold like he does his underwear with holes in it. (which by the way...found a \"gently\" used pair of underwear. nice.)  Anyway, I was able to purchase 20 dollars of food from the Nevada Chicken Cafe. I started off on my long walk to what could potentially be...chicken nirvana.  I was about 2.3 miles away.  I got there 5 days later. It all started when I tried to walk an old lady across the street...and then...well...lets just say that it went wrong.  I did think that Scottsdale was nice.\n\nWhen I did arrive at the Nevada Chicken Cafe, a lovely Dutchman pulled me the last 30 miles on a sled. (Long story...but you will always pay your debts to Rex...and Rex knows his Mel's Diner trivia.)  When Rex pulled up he was immediately struck by the smell. It was amazing. They had an outside grill\/smoker going on and it was impressive. The chicken, ribs, spices, mesquite, all made me want to go in and order as much as I could. \n\nRex forced the Dutchman to order one whole chicken, one half chicken, a side of salad and it came with some BBQ sauce and tortillas. The tortillas were gratis. Gracias for the gratis. Rex found an empty mobile home and sat down with my feast. I was starving. Grave robbing is a lot more difficult than you would think. What is even more difficult is finding a landlord that will take a burial dress and skull in lieu of payment. Trust me...in Scottsdale no one has the kind of loot Princess Diana's had...not that Rex would know...anyway...\n\n...for the equivalent of 21.50 Rex was well fed. Rex fed well for 2 meals.  The chicken was excellent. The mesquite was subtle but flavorful. It didn't overpower the meat and was really good. The BBQ sauce is exceptional. Rex doesn't like an overly sweet sauce and this one isn't. It is well balanced and not too overpowering on the chicken. it works with the plain chicken better than the mesquite rubbed.  Rex was so impressed he has gone back several times and tried the ribs and some other sides.  The baby back ribs are among the best ribs in Las Vegas. They are fall off the bone and the extremely flavorful.  The St. Louis ribs are good, but they aren't great. Rex didn't love that it wasn't sauced enough. The sauce is sweeter and that is fine, but St. Louis ribs should be HEAVILY sauced...and these aren't. \n\nThe chicken...well...when done right it is the best. It is a excellent piece of chicken. The problem is that there is no consistency. Rex has had dry pieces and he has had perfect pieces...and this is a MAJOR issue. If you are only doing a few things they have to be perfect. In fairness I have had more good than bad...but I have had enough bad to not necessarily want the crap shoot when I am paying good grave robbing money. \n\nThe sides are were everything falls apart.  The Mac and Cheese...and Rex loves the mac and cheese...isn't good. Under seasoned (the only thing that is), and mash potatoes are so peppery it is of the charts. Rex loves pepper. He would roll himself in pepper and find a nice salt covered girl to mix with...but this is too much pepper. The fruit salad wasn't cleaned as well (the tough pieces) as it should be, and the mixed veggies were okay, but nothing great.  The black beans were okay, but again nothing to write home about and didn't taste like they were simmered in a rich enough stock. The sweet potatoes were a real stand out and should be eaten as the side. \n\nA huge special shout out for the garlic ranch sauce...get a few tubs of it. perfect with the chicken and the salad. Amazing taste. \n\nRex has dated his fair share of unstable women. It adds a little spice. A little mystery. A little arousal. Eventually no matter how good post release from jail sex can be...it is time to go.  In his eateries Rex demands stability. Consistency. Reliability. Excellence. Rex is all of those things and more.\n\nSpend your money and time on a shrine to Rex. He will spend his money on gas and whores.","date":"2011-07-09 21:52:11"}

I have sworn by this meal to people as I think it's one of the best. My recent visit I was let down a lot. \n\nI walk in, wrote down my usual and look at the cashier and she walks away.

It's usually a real teriyaki sauce and tastes delicious. I picked up my weapon of choice, my fork, and dive right in. I was shocked by the disgusting flavor and texture I received from the teriyaki chicken. In disbelief I let my friend try some and she was shocked at how gross it was too. So I put the teriyaki aside for the fly that kept flying around. \n\nI then headed towards the jade red chicken quesadilla. It tasted normal and great but they definitely shorted me on the chicken.

Look on Yelp and you'll find good ones that can make getting in a breeze. \n2: When you go here, don't take anything that the security people could think is suspicious. Eye drops, Tylenol, even prescriptions will have security either tossing it or giving you a major attitude. In some cases I've seen people flat out turned away and if you protest, your exit is pretty much assured. \n3: Once you're in your best deal is to get a day bed or a cabana. Otherwise it's a PITA to keep track of any personal items you bring in. And space becomes almost non-existent fast. When a big name DJ is there, you'll be thinking this is what being a sardine in a can feels like. \n4: Bottle service. It just saves so much hassle. Pay up, do it, you won't regret it.\n5: Don't think you can do your best Michael Phelps imitation and swim at EBC. You're eye candy and really nothing more than a 2 legged ATM to them. Float in the water, check out the people, enjoy the experience, and try not to annoy the \"lifeguards\" who use their whistles to spoil your fun with any chance they get. \n6: SERIOUS FYI: Beware of the cuties. That cute woman you're staring at that comes up to talk to you and gets you to blow half your Vegas budget at the bar? She could be an independent contractor, one of approximately 50, yes I said FIFTY different women, hired each day \/ night for the express purpose of being fun eye candy to entice you to spend money at the bar and on amenities. The women doing this work can make VERY reasonable money doing so, and all you get at the end is a lighter wallet and no chance of anything else. This isn't a sour grapes thing, I know some women who work here and know how it works. I'm just a local sharing what I know so that maybe you can save some money. Don't say nobody warned ya. \n7: Don't gripe about drink prices. EBC pours some STIFF DRINKS for that $17 you just dropped, and don't forget to tip. \n\nOverall, EBC is one of Wynn's cash cows. They continue to find innovative ways to extract maximum revenue from you and if you don't want to cough up the cash there's a long line of people that do.

It may be there NOW, but it wasn't when we were there. You know how I know that? Because when I complained to the waitress about the cash-only policy not being on the door, where it SHOULD be posted, she would have told me it was on the menu. She didn't.  Also, I'm a very careful reader (I'm an auditor by trade)- I would have seen it, and so would my coworker. So nice try, but no. Besides, the larger point still stands: not accepting cards, in 2014, where more consumer transactions are by credit or debit card (42%) than by cash (40%) (stats as of 2012, I'm sure the gap is much wider now), is just friggin' STUPID, and it  inconveniences customers. Why would you do that??? Oh yeah-- you'd do it to keep from documenting all your transactions to avoid paying taxes. Or at least some people would. I'm sure these fine folks would never engage in such unseemly activity.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nI was sitting here writing a 5-star review for this place while I waited for the check. I had three really good paragraphs on how good the food was. And then everything changed. \n\n\"Sorry, we're cash and check only. We don't accept cards.\"\n\nI cannot begin to properly articulate the absurdity of this. Seriously??? In 20 frickin' 14, when lots of people don't carry currency, much less check books, you don't accept cards? Really???\n\nAnd to make it worse, THERE'S NO SIGN AT THE ENTRANCE warning patrons of this ridiculous policy. So you are done eating and in their debt before you realize that you're boned.  \n\nAnyway, the waitress says there's an ATM on premise, but it only works sometimes. Yeah, well, it didn't work for me or my coworker. \n\nSo next we were directed to a bank down the street with an ATM. Luckily, some other diners told us about a much closer place across the street with an ATM.\n\nSo after being embarrassed in front of all the folks sitting around us and walking across the street to withdraw money (and paying a fee to do so), I was finally free of this awful place. \n\nGood food or not, I'd never go back because they don't have the courtesy to forewarn people about their nonsensical payment terms. Unreal.\n\nAlso, if our server is reading this, you got a minuscule tip because I deducted the $3 in ATM fees I lost over this episode, plus $1 for the embarrassment and $1 for having to walk to an ATM. I know you didn't make the no cards policy, so it's not technically your fault, but you were sort of unsympathetic (my coworker said uppity) about it, and perhaps this will cause you to encourage your bosses to reconsider this foolishness.","date":"2014-08-15 19:31:30"}

I ask the driver to take us to the Mandalay Bay Hotel. This is where my friend who was to be married in a couple days said for me to go. The driver gets me and the woman to the hotel in about 15 minutes. (It was around 6pm and high traffic.) We get the Mandalay Bay Hotel, split the fair and tip, say good bye to each other, and I get on my cell to call Eva (the bride) to tell her I was there.\nShe gives me directions to the elevator.\n\"Left of the reception desk..\"\n\"What reception desk?\" I interrupt her.\n\"In the front.\" She says.\n\"There's no reception desk,...oh wait. There's a reception desk to the left.\"\n\"What?\" She's confused. \"What hotel are you at?\"\nI pause. Trick question? \"The fracken' Mandalay Bay Hotel! Dammit! Where the hell am I suppose to fracken' be!\"\n(fracken: bsg lingo. I say this when I'm in public, rather than the word \"fuck\".)\n\"At THE hotel, dummy!\" She says, to me as if the problem is solved.\n\"I'm AT the fracken' hotel.\" I tell her.\n\"No. THE hotel. The hotel is call THE hotel.\" She implores.\n\"What THE hell is THAT suppose to mean, and where THE hell is it?!\"\n\"It's part of the Mandalay Bay Hotel\" Eva informs me.\n\"Oh frack! I call you back.\" I hang up the cell.\nI walk up to the reception desk to my left, which is actually an information desk.\nGood. \"'Scuse me?\" I say to the Obiwan Kenobi (old version) looking gentleman. \"I'm lost.\" Fairly comfortable with being a tourist. \"I need to get to THE hotel.\"\nHe proceeds to direct me.\nLeft of the elevators. House of Blues. Theatres. Casino. Got it.\n5 minutes later.

The ladies were hot.\nThe lounge is cool. Really comfortable chaise and tables. Every thing is black, brown, beige, stone, steel, glass. Industrial elegance.\nWhen it comes to drinking. I'm simple. Double Chivas over and a Perrier.\nAfter 2 orders of these, we remember that we were suppose to have dinner. \nWe had another round, because we were waiting for the groom to return with the tuxes.\nAfter dinner I returned there to read and drink. I don't gamble so I was pretty happy with my book, scotch, Perrier and smokes.\nIt was a quiet night so I got to chat with the servers a bit. They were very personable and friendly. Nice people altogether.\nDespite the hookers and johns that frequented THE lounge, it was a really comfortable place to hangout, people watch, just plain lounge.\nI was there at least twice every day till Sunday. \nGreat place.\n\nTHE cafe:\nI ended going here about 1:15 am in the morning.\nI was surprised that I was hungry, since I ate like a pig at the wedding reception earlier that evening. But, there I was, hungry. I was out of smokes so I stopped off at THE store to by a pack of P-funks and walk around to see if there was anything like a BK or something. \nNothing.\nI go to the lounge and get a beer and have a couple cigarettes.\nAs I was about to head up to the suite, I see that THE cafe was open and thought \"What the hell, another $10.00 sandwich it is.\"\nI asked the hostess if I could order my food to take up to my room, and she said \"Of course, you can.\" With a big smile.\nI look through the menu, don't find what I was looking for. What I order is a Chicken Mole' Quesadilla with \"aoxoan ?\" and Grilled Poblanos. Also a order of fries.\n$20.00 with tip.\nI'm irritated a bit. \"This better be fucken good!\" I think to myself.\nAfter about a 20 minute wait and a smoke. I get my food and head back to my room.\nI spread my food out on the coffee table and start with the quesadilla.\n\"OH SHIT! This is good. It's not even close to being a good mole', or real Mexican, and what ever \"aoxoan?\" is I don't know. But...\"bite, chomp,chomp,chomp\" this is fucken great!\nFries?\nCrispy, hot, a little spicy.\nWhat's this white sauce?\nMayo with lemon, garlic, herbs. Not bad.

Their lattes are also masterful.\n\nThey used to sell Phil & Sebastian beans, but now they have started roasting their own. It was a bit of a learning process, but now they've got it down.

The sweeping ceilings, modern art again historic architecture and definitive lighting illuminate every floor. Also, every floor is totally different... if you've seen one floor, you've seen one floor.\n\nCPL has standout collections in many departments, but for the sake of brevity, I'll mention a couple of my favorites: international languages, popular movies\/music and fiction. The language section is particularly legit: they have current collections of magazines, books and pop culture broken up by country, and the language learning section is super plentiful. Seriously, I have never seen such a well stocked and LARGE collection of language DVDs, CDs, and computer programs, including Rosetta Stone. So if you're like me and have been bad at keeping up with your German, get your butt to this floor immediately. No waiting on crazy long wait lists for these Rosetta Stones. Literally, its like a Christmas miracle.\n\nOverall, don't overlook the CPL if you need a place to do work, make a home office, or just want to read and write.

Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza.

So why the two stars? The food is where this place falls flat on its face. \n\nWe went in on a Monday night. There was one other couple seated at a table and a few people at the bar. Other than that, it was a bunch of staff mulling around with nothing to do. Ghost town.\n\nI was starving and ready to hop all over the menu. We got the Warm Root Salad (which wasn't bad, but also wasn't warm), two miso bowls which were just average, and two sushi rolls which were just plain not good. On one roll the rice was very compacted and dry, to the point where it was almost inedible without adding soy sauce, yet somehow the second roll was soggy and mushy. My lady companion is from Hawaii and knows her sushi. She said it tasted like the rolls sat in the fridge all night and then they just topped them with fresh fish, which I have to concur. The mushrooms in our miso bowls were clearly dried and then rehydrated. The quality of ingredients was just underwhelming. \n\nAlso, I ordered a Moscow Mule, which didn't taste bad, but it also didn't taste like it had a drop of alcohol in it. I wasn't going to say anything, but when my server asked how the Mule was, I answered honestly, \"It tastes a little weak...\" Her response was, \"Oh...I'll have to let the bartender know.\" But that was it. No offer to remake it, comp it, or anything. $10 for a weak drink is kind of lame. \n\nOur bill was about $60 and I still left a nice tip because our server was nice, but I see no reason to return here. I was still kind of hungry when I left and would have ordered more if the food were better.

Thanks Yelpers!!!  The food and service at this place are China-licious!  The prices are just $, a bargain!\n\nThe Dragon Palace is tucked away in the corner of an older strip center on the east side of N 32rd just north of E Thunderbird.  It looks like it's been here for years, and I mean a lot of years...  But don't let deter you from trying the Dragon Palace!\n\nRestaurant~ the decor is old.  It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.  \n\nService~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.\n\nFood~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!  \n\nTheir menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say \"we are going to go and eat Chinese\" and I would say \"mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?\"  \n\nAfter a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.\n\nAll of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!\n\nI'm looking forward to going \"Back in Time\" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.  Hopefully I will see you there.","date":"2011-10-06 00:09:12"}

Another is the open kitchen which offers a different view into the kitchen than most.\n\nWe ordered a flight of beer which was plentiful however the beer simply wasn't very good.  2 of 10 stars\n\nWe had an appetizer of the Vegas fries.  I expected more flavor from the king of flavortown but you could hardly taste the blue cheese.  The buffalo sauce was good but not fire hot.  I did enjoy the large twisted steak fries and the fries were probably the best part of the night. 6 of 10 stars\n\nI ordered the mac and cheese burger.  I was expecting a well cooked burger with a cheddary taste from the mac.  Instead I got an overcooked burger that reminded me of fat burger. In fact, Liz helpfully suggested we smash the burger down in order to eat it without too much mess.  THe mac had absolutely no cheese flavor and could have been simply boiled pasta if it didn't have a slightly orangy color.  I did like the bun but not enough to salvage the burger.  4 of 10 stars\n\nMy SO ordered the rock shrimp mini tacos. This was the most disappointing thing of the night.  The rubbery corn tortillas were bland and aside from the pickled onions there was no flavor at all. The shrimp was definitely overcooked in the frying process and the chili sauce could not save the dish. 1 of 10 stars\n\nI like Guy's shows because he is animated and truly seems to enjoy his food but after dining here I seriously question his tastebuds, or his commitment to his restaurants.  I will say this restaurant reflects my perception of Guy's on screen personality, which is a blur of ADD ridden angst with a lot of flare and little substance.  I will not rule out a return visit if someone visits who has to see guy's restaurant and I hope there are improvements but I see no reason to seek out this disappointing hot mess anytime soon.","date":"2014-07-18 13:49:50"}

The girl behind the counter was SUPER friendly and very informative.  She was fantastic to talk to and learn about their product.  They serve Ecuadorian gelato.  Who knew that was a thing?  Not me.  But it's fantastic.  And their gelato is 100% natural fruit, no artificial flavors, dairy-free, and dye-free.  (But since they realize fruity flavors won't appeal to everyone, they do have chocolate and vanilla ice cream, too.)  \n\nWe sampled a variety of flavors.  A lot of them are made from South American fruits I've never heard of.  I decided on Tamarind as my flavor of choice this time around, planning to return to have cups of many of the other flavors in the future.  (You can also do half and half on flavors if you want to.)

Nothing really stood out to me here, and yes, I have had some great renditions of this simple dish :)\n\nTonkotsu Ramen Noodles ($5 add). This was delicious! Much better than I was expecting actually. The Pork was cooked to a crisp on the edges, so it had a nice consistency and flavor, but the insides were a little less tender than others around town.  Solid choice though!\n\nThird Course : Spicy Tuna Roll. This was ok...decent flavor in the roll and fish tasted fresh.  Don't expect anything out of the ordinary here.\n\nAnd to finish, I wasn't sure if I was going to order dessert or just a drink.

This was surprisingly tart from the yuzu juice. It was very overpowering, so if you aren't a fan of yuzu, stay away! If you enjoy yuzu though, it's pretty tasty...just very tart.\n\nOverall, lunch felt a tad spendy at $25+, but considering the location and how good the Ramen was, I would say it was worth it!\n\nGive it a try...esp if you are craving ramen in the area :)\n\nPics:","date":"2013-12-14 03:17:40"}

I'm saddened and frustrated, really. BLD is a cool place with a fantastic pedigree that I want so badly to like, but it just won't let me.\n\nToday's breakfast was my second visit. The first was for lunch shortly after opening. It was an unmitigated disaster. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at that time, but can't avoid Yelping at this point.\n\nHad the short ribs Benedict. Although the eggs were poached nearly perfectly, they were covered in a bland red wine Hollandaise that looked like melted Silly Putty and lacked the citrusy brightness that a good Holalndaise should have. The short ribs were pot-roasty, rather than the velvety melt-in-your mouth delight that you'd expect. Overall, the dish was under-seasoned and wan, but you couldn't complain that the short ribs were too rich.\n\nThe side of potatoes and onions was good with the exception of the fact that the onions were inconsistently cooked; some were crunchy while others were soft and beginning to brown. I'd prefer better browning and a nice crust, but seasoning was spot-on here at least.\n\nMy wife had the Spaniard scramble, which arrived looking more like an omelette gone bad than a scramble. The linguica provided the only seasoning; sadly it was underrepresented and the rest of the dish needed salt.\n\nMy latte was great, and at a $0.50 premium over brewed coffee, can't be beat.\n\nOn both visits, the staff has been a disappointment. Today's server was clearly trained NOT to ask how things were. Either that, or she was oblivious. She didn't return to check in once during our meal and delivered our check silently. The hostess was cute but clueless. I forgot my morning paper in the car, and when I went outside to get it, she welcomed me for a second time when I returned. She did an admirable job of pretending she remembered I'd already been seated in the half-empty restaurant when I told her I had a table, at any rate.\n\nAs a big fan of Cork, BLD has been a tremendous disappointment on two visits. While I'd like to be a regular at one of the spacious booths every weekend, I guess I'll have to settle for a trip to Cork every few months instead.","date":"2011-11-13 05:23:39"}

Maybe it's the awkward conversations you overhear as they describe how they decided on their college major, or the clumsy way they are sharing a soda. Either way it's still an excellent date spot.  \n\nAtmosphere: The set up is a classic soda fountain style, with the stools and counter in the front, but additional\nTables in the second room as well. My only problem was, on my last visit, the bathrooms were very messy. The tables were not the cleanest either. Granted it was a Friday night so they were busy, but it wasn't the most pleasant dining experience.\n\nFood: I love the ice cream. They give you generous portions, and have creative options, like a chocolate dipped waffle cone. I think this is a creative option. I usually order the same dishes here, so for me, everything else seems daring. I usually get one of the following: lemon sorbet, vanilla or chocolate ice cream with fudge, or mint chocolate chip.

We snagged a table by the door and after about 10 minutes of eating I watched a homeless man, that was struggling to even walk, slowly make his way to exit the door from using the restroom. Just by looking at him, I could tell he hadn't eaten a good meal in awhile, and sadness just emanated from his eyes. I physically could not sit there and not offer him some of my food, which I would have been throwing out anyways.\n\nI invited him to our table to enjoy some of our leftovers.The manager came by immediately and hovered over our table, while very clearly disrespecting the guest which I had invited to our table. Even going out of his way to criticize the man for apparently \"begging for our food.\" I made a point to ensure him that this was not the case. I then asked him, politely, to retrieve a to-go box and some disposable silverware. He found the smallest box possible, neglected to provide silverware, and basically threw it onto the table without saying a word. The manager of this establishment embarrassed me in front of our guest and I was not going to let that fly. After providing the man with food and finally obtaining silverware, the homeless man went on his way and thanked us profusely.\n\nI then went to the back, near the kitchen, and decided to have a word with the manager in front of his employees. Once again, the manager was disrespectful to me, after I had just spent $30 that morning in his restaurant. He lied to my face - telling me that he is always coming in and begging, which I found hard to believe as he was frightened to even talk to us when I physically had to stop him. I told him that because he had embarrassed me in front of my guest and the entire restaurant, I would now be embarrassing him in front of all of his employees for his atrocious arrogance. I will no longer be stepping foot into this establishment, ever again. The manager is a pity excuse for what it means to run a business, and I feel bad for the employees that have to work under him. It is basic human decency to treat everyone with respect, and I hope this taught him a lesson on humility.\n\nSnooze is a much better alternative, with fantastic staff, and is only about 3 minutes away!","date":"2016-02-15 14:55:04"}

The food was all delicious, fries were crisp and seasoned well.  The staff was friendly and my order to go was ready in just a few minutes.  \n\nThe fries weren't piping hot when I got them which means they were probably sitting for at least a short time but stayed crisp till I finished them, and were seasoned really well.

Simply put, the food is tasty, cheap, and plentiful. You can't go wrong with that.\n\nWe typically order one noodle or fried rice dish. I highly recommend the Manchurian style which is a mild combination of sweet and spicy. And you get a choice of two proteins too! The classic is with chicken and shrimp. There's always a healthy amount toppings in your fried rice and noodles; these are some hefty carb dishes. As for portion size, they give you enough to feed an extra two more people than you would think! We seem to get two extra bowls of white rice which is a nice gesture. Can't ever get enough carbs right?\n\nI won't go into too much about the protein dishes here but the main idea with Indian Hakka food is that there isn't too much being done besides having your choice of protein in a certain sauce\/style; the main proteins being chicken, beef, shrimp, and fish. My favourite here has to be the garlic sauce which is very savory. It's a somewhat sweet garlicky sauce. Besides that, the chicken pakora is very good here although I do recommend to have that at the restaurant for the maximum crispiness. In addition, the sizzling plates are also a good bet here. Again, I recommend to have that at the restaurant. You do get that extra iron skillet taste to it. \n\nSome things to note: 10% off if you pay by cash for takeout orders. And minimum $15 purchase for debit use and $20 for credit use. You can also get fortune cookies for takeout which they will give to you, but only upon request.","date":"2017-05-06 03:16:56"}

So I mention it first, so it's not the last thing you read.\n\nMy review is focused on 3 things; service, food, desert.  On the service front, The Cheesecake Cafe has been consistently good and occasionally great.  The servers are always friendly and the orders show up as requested.\n\nAs far as food is concerned, The Cheesecake Cafe is actually pretty good.  I have dined here on a few occasions without the intent of enjoying desert, based solely on the quality of the food.  Granted, nothing really stands out on the menu in my eyes, but the food is always prepared well and tasted good.\n\nNow for my favourite part, desert.  I believe I have had all of their cheesecakes.  At least I hope so.  No, wait, I hope I haven't.  One more excuse to go back.  The cheesecake here is fantastic, which I suppose it should be given it's namesake.

Well, I have to say this might have been my finest 1 2 punch in terms of dinner and desert in one evening. \n\nThe place is in a bit of a crap area, and quite frankly my girlfriend and I were like...wtf? Where is this random 5 star place in the middle of all this junk? From the outside it's very understated and unassuming, but inside was very nice. Reminded me of nicer cold stones. \n\nAnyway, we got in and the owner who I believe was Desyree asked if it was our first time. We said yup, just moved to the area 3 weeks ago. She then launched into an unbelievable tour of the gelato. Without asking, she started handing us sample after sample and guiding us as to what we were experiencing at what her methodology was. She was one of the most passionate and friendly business owners I've ever met, one of the ones that truly stand out. \n\nOne moment in particular was quite surreal, she gives me the Cioccolato e Peperoncino (chocolate with red chile), and as she confidently hands it to me she tells me that I'll get a nice chocolate flavor and then in about five seconds it will hit the back of my throat with spice. I had already put in my mouth as she was saying that, and like clockwork the spice hit my mouth and throat. It was incredible. I ordered that along with cookie butter and amazing strawberry cheesecake gelato. She also gave me a taste of AVOCADO gelato. Talk about experimenting with flavors! It was spot on too. This woman is unbelievable at what she does. \n\nMy girlfriend got the fruity flavors, which were the most authentic tasting fruit gelato I've ever had. This woman very clearly is an artist, and she takes this stuff very seriously and is passionate about it. For me, this place is the epitome of a five star establishment. Incredible product, reasonable prices, local owners, and owners that are extremely passionate about customer service and the quality they put out. \n\nThis place and Soho sushi are two perfect examples of local businesses that I want to support forever, and I hope they continue to have such success in the local community. With passion and quality like this, something tells me they will.","date":"2014-05-30 17:18:37"}

I'm not a coffee snob... in other words, I couldn't tell you what side of the hill the coffee beans grew on, what country it was grown in or who roasted it... That's because I'm a Apple snob. I use a MacBook, an iPhone and soon the iPad - that's another story and another review for a different day.\n\nI\"m a big fan of coffee and a bigger fan on THIS particular Second Cup. \n\nWhy? Why Second Cup over Starbucks just 500 metres away? They both make great coffee, great treats, great products...\n\nSo WHY?\n\nWell, for one... Second Cup is a CANADIAN business. THIS Second Cup is privately owned vs. being a \"Corporate Store\". \n\nStarbucks doesn't NEED my money. Neither does Second Cup (the Corporation) ...however, THIS Second Cup is owned & operated by Laura and her very nice family who visibly LOVE what they do and truly want to make a measurable difference in my day... in YOUR day. \n\nLaura and her Second Cup are also involved in local community events... \n\nThat's not to say other coffee shops don't feel and act the same way as Laura.... I've been to the Starbucks in Copperfield and they're very nice people... but when given a choice, I choose to INVEST my money into local community business owners. \n\nMcKenzie Towne IS my community and Laura IS the owner. \n\nThe very fact that Laura know's my name after only a few visits demonstrates that she cares about my business. I can't say that for the Starbucks 500 metres away... and that, to me, is worth something which is why Laura and her staff have EARNED my loyalty.\n\nOh, the coffee? Always hot, the way I like it.\n\nthe food? Always tasty, the way I like it.\n\nStaff - they get the order right, the way I like it.\n\nComfortable seating - the way my backside likes it.\n\nParking - never a problem...\n\nBut Vince... they don't have a drive through... Really? That's a big deal? \n\nWell, I for one could use the exercise... seriously, I could use the exercise... and at the end of the day... so could you (insert cheeky grin here).\n\nWe all have a choice - I choose my local family owned Second Cup.\n\nLarge Vanilla Bean Latte, please :)\n\nPS: I don't charge extra for typo's - they're just my gift to you ;-)","date":"2012-04-11 05:47:33"}

Today it's not anything like it was when we were young(er) and (less) foolish.\n\nThis open space is for me best described as the poor man's Time's Square.  On a commercialized level you have your larger than life bill boards with special designs some unique to the area.  They change all the time right?  In this big and open space you have a more open area than Times Sq though IMO.  It's not as tight or verticle and more sunny than shady.\n\nThe YD Square is your south east corner of Yonge and Dundas.  City TV is visible from the near Victoria street and Dundas area.  The live studio has been in this area for years now since moving from the building at Queen and John.  The open area is a place for concerts for the public or smaller events where food is cooked.  \n\nThere are some tickets to venues being sold closer to the Dundas northern part of the square mirroring the somewhat TKTS stand in Times Square.  There are however not any photo panderers like in Times Square I've seen.  There are no Wolverine or Spider-man or Batman superheros.  There are no Silver Man or Naked Cowboys playing guitar seeking gratuities for photos being taken.  \n\nYonge and Dundas Square for the most part is just a big open concrete piece of prime real estate.  Only a few times have I seen something of significance going on here but then again I don't go to the city very often.\n\nIt's nice to have an open space in the city but some green would have been nice... today it's still a poor man's Times Square and there's even a theater or two nearby.  \n\nAnything that's big and needs a large city square is at Nathan Phillips Square in front of city hall instead of this place.\n\nStill this place has a lot of memories for me but mostly before it was what it is now when the coin op arcades were still on Yonge and the corner was that jean store.\n\nYDQ has changed so much just like 42nd street in NYC but it is much more cleaner and touristy now than before because Yonge and Dundas is a very lively part of town.","date":"2015-03-24 17:12:33"}

To make sure to get your money's worth and to make the most of your visit, I would suggest the following:\n\n- Take public transportation, traffic and parking are terrible with all the construction in the area.\n- READ THE REVIEWS AND TIPS. Don't order something that other reviewers hated then give them a low rating because you didn't like it, not cool.\n- Bring a friend or two so you can sample other flavors AND so they can take pictures of you with your cool ice cream.\n- Take lots of pics and videos to relive your experience and share with others.\n- Walk down the street afterwards so you can show off your fancy treat, believe me, you'll get noticed. It's a good excuse to explore the neighborhood.  \n- Cross off another thing from your foodie bucket list.\n\nCute store with friendly staff. Nitrogen ice cream is very smooth in texture and it comes in a vented double cup that has liquid Nitrogen in the bottom section, so you're ice cream has that cool smoking effect. Triple chocolate is a winner and it comes with 2 toasted marshmallows on top YUM!

Don't come here if you've got places to be! Can you imagine if you went to Starbucks and it took them 20 minutes to make you drinks?\n\nAnyways, the drinks were good. They definitely have a good brand, I assume it's a franchise. This location definitely needs to either have their workers speed things up or schedule more people. Although the drinks were fairly good, the long wait was really disappointing.","date":"2018-06-12 18:24:28"}

Organization- Things in the store are often spread out all over the place. This isn't true for things like a baseball bat that are sport specific. But I was trying to find a few things (water bottle, gym towel) and they had at least 3 places in the store where different versions of these items were located so you have to walk around everywhere or risk missing what you are looking for.\n\n2. Prices- for the most part you can get things cheaper online. The major important exception to this is sale prices. You can sign up for their email alerts and when they have a sale you can find insane discounts of 50% or more on a lot of products. I almost never shop here when there isn't a sale now a days. Sometimes I am willing to pay a small amount more to have the product instantly but oftentimes I just wait for amazon prime. If you dont have the amazon app to price check I would highly recommend it. \n\n3.

I found Payless Pizza #2 here on Yelp along with a few other joints and decided to give it a shot. Vinny has a $9.99 cash pickup special and I'll tell you what - I've paid more than double that price for pizza that wasn't even half as good. The second or third day I came in, Vinny told me with pride that he'd been called the \"Legal drug dealer of pizza\" - and I was hooked. I spent nearly $250 on pizza here over the past month, eventually giving up on the rest of the pizza joints I've been trying out. The pizza is hot, melty and just greasy enough to lubricate the heart and soul. Admittedly, I haven't tried anything besides the pepperoni but I'd be willing to bet it's all just as good. As a side note, I gained about 6 pounds of pure muscle from eating a whole pie every day while lifting. For the quality and price, you can't beat this place.

Not horrible for sushi, but not exactly inexpensive.  Remember, nobody waits your table or brings you drinks, and your forks are plastic.  There were only two other tables with people at them, but our food still took 22 minutes to bring out.  Then they forgot an item we had ordered.

I asked for hot sauce but it took a while to come (and it was not busy) I only had it on 1 of the 3 tacos. A suggestion would be to have hot sauce in bottles at each table or have them accessible to customers in a central location so I could of just grabbed it when I wanted it...I had a margarita that was more ice and sweet flavour then lime and salt like I am used to... It was served in a plastic glass (kinda tacky) I would of loved it to be in a Mexican blue rimmed glass. They did not come around much to see if we wanted another drink and it took awhile for them to clear the table. We decided to split the churos with caramel dipping sauce and they were fresh and hot. \nAll in all I was kinda disappointed in the lack of flavours like spicy or lime or cilantro. And found the service kinda slow and the chairs really uncomfortable that I did not want to stick around for another drink. I will maybe try it again as they're still new it I won't be rushing back.","date":"2015-03-22 13:02:47"}

Since we were a little early for our reservation, she suggested that we sit at the bar for a cocktail and appetizer since it was still happy hour. \n\nOur cocktail server was very polite and promptly took our drink orders.  We decided to have the oysters on the half shell which were just delicious.  We sat at the bar with our drinks and appetizer for about 30 minutes when our server introduced herself and showed us to our table. We were able to transfer our tab from the bar to our table. We of course tipped our cocktail server because she took such good care of us.\n\nOnce at our table, our server went over the menu. We decided to order a bottle of wine because we were there for the whole experience.  She brought us and poured our wine and preceeded to tell us about the menu. One of the appetizers on the menu I have never tried before so we decided to order it. The oysters rockefeller,  oh my goodness, it was heaven in my mouth. I would go back just to eat 3 or 4 orders of it for dinner! I finally decided on having the stuffed crab for dinner.  My friend chose the scallops (which I have had before and they melt in your mouth). \n\nLet me tell you about the lobster I had. It was stuffed with crab meat and scallops and I couldn't get enough of it! It was so good! Our server took the time to crack  the claws and I'm so glad she did because the meat inside of those claws was phenomenal.  It was fresh and cooked to perfection.\n\nAfter the amazing dinner we had just experienced, our server asked if we were ready for desert. Now, I couldn't eat one more bite because I had consumed about 2 pounds of amazing, fresh and perfectly cooked food. She suggested after dinner drinks. Heck yeah! More drinks? Why not? So she and another server suggested a drink called Nuts and Berries. My friend and I decided that we would have that. Holy cow! It was probably the most amazing after dinner drink I ever had! I would love to know how you make it. \n\nAll in all i recommend this place to everyone. Between the fresh food, the intimate atmosphere and the wonderful and caring staff, I will definitely be back. The happy hour is amazing, the service is amazing and the food is amazing. Thank you Salt Cellar for an wonderful dining experience! I'll be back :)","date":"2016-05-24 06:39:41"}

But I stayed and experienced for myself just how delusional and menacing he is. \n\nWhile I was looking at the succulents, he asked me if I wanted something, and I told him, plainly, that I was fine. When it was clear to him that I was not going to invest emotion in our exchange (I just wanted to get my succulent and get out), he towered over me and asked, threateningly, if he had offended me. I told him that he had, and that I thought he could've handled the situation with the other customers more professionally.\n\nHe crinkled up his face and started to rant about the temperature and how people can't touch the succulents and blah blah blah, so I turned away and walked out the door.

My Daughter went to this location for an oil\/filter change and opted for a full synthetic oil change which with labor cost $71.98\n\nShe had the work done on a Thursday afternoon and I was shocked of what she told me on Friday morning. One of her co-workers is a good friend and certified mechanic and just to make sure the oil filter was actually changed, he marked the filter with a sharpie pen in the shape of a star. Sure enough, the mark was still there so the oil filter had not been changed!\n\nI also decided to check the oil in her vehicle and when I pulled out the dipstick, two things were immediate. First, the oil was over-filled past the hash marks and in fact past the indents on the dipstick. Over filling the oil in the engine causes oil-foaming and increased pressure. Second, the oil was quite dirty and didn't look like it had been changed at all! I do my own oil changes on my vehicle with the same full synthetic oil and when I get done, it's tough to see where the oil is on the dipstick because it's so clean, even a day afterwards.\n\nI went with my Daughter back to Big-O to discuss the matter with the manager, Richard. Upon entering the facility I asked the person behind the register if the manager Richard was there and he said yes about the same time Richard said from an adjoining office (I couldn't see him) said \"Yes, I'm here, can I help you?\". Speaking from the register I told Richard I needed to see him outside and he politely asked me to wait momentarily. \n\nAs we walked to my Daughters car, we discussed what happened and he told me it was a simply oversight that the filter wasn't changed. Richard was very courteous and apologetic as I discussed how could this have happened when a facility like this should exude honesty and trust especially with the monies paid to have the job done properly. He did mention they were busy that day and again said it was an oversight.\n\nYou will have to forgive me in saying, \"An oversight?!\" That's like buying four new tires and forgetting to install the two front tires....a critical 50% of 'a job done is a job done well'. \n\nWhen I tried to do the oil change on the vehicle, I discovered the oil drain plug threads were stripped and there was NO WAY it could come off at all. This was the second time my daughter went to them.  This means they never changed the oil!\n\nThey did refund her money and we went right to Firestone on S. Ft. Apache and Flamingo and $600 dollars later, she had a new oil pan with plug. This Firestone location has always done a stellar job.\n\nThis makes me think what else did they rip me off for? \n\nDON'T GO TO THIS BIG-O!

An experience at the Encore Beach Club can only be explained as an expensive, infuriating trip through airport security.\n\nMaybe I was spoiled by the amazing service everywhere else during my stay at the Encore. Maybe I'm the unreasonable one for expecting a consistent level of service throughout the same company. Everywhere else in the Encore (including the other clubs) has amazing service. At the Beach Club, it's a borderline police-state.\n\nMe and my girlfriend spent the previous day at the Encore's European pool and had a blast. We also went to the Encore's nightclub, XS, the night before and had a great time there as well. I expected the Beach Club to be a hybrid of these two positive experiences, but the end-result was the worst of both worlds.\n\nWhen we showed up at 2pm, pre-purchased tickets in hand, we were surprised to see that there was only two lines; one for cabanas, one for all other guests, no expedited line for hotel guests and\/or ones with advance-tickets. We had to wait in line for almost an hour.\n\nThere is only one sign while you're in line which warns you of the pool's policies: \"no illegal drugs allowed\". In case you can't read, the manager, Alfonso, reinforces the point with an indiscriminate TSA-esque verbal berating of everybody waiting in line. There were no other signs posted about any other policies.\n\nOnce we got through that line, we encountered an unexpected baggage inspection of my girlfriend's purse. This is nothing like the Encore's nightclub, XS, which had no bag-inspection whatsoever. The inspector said that the purse had to be checked at the baggage claim for $10. We had to wait in line at the baggage claim for about 15 minutes to do this.\n\nIt should also be noted you basically can't have any pills in your bag. If you're on any medical regiment requiring pills being taken at a specific time of the day, you're out of luck. It's easier for them to assume that everybody is addicted to opiates than to show any level of accommodation.\n\nWe finally get into the party. It looked like it might have been fun, but honestly, not fun enough to overcome our frustration with their whole set-up. The place was crowded, and was composed of over 75% guys. What few girls that were there would segregate themselves into their own cliques and there was very little interaction between the two sexes; very similar to a middle-school dance.\n\nWe get to the bar (15 minute line there). I order a round of drinks and ask to charge it to the room. The bartender says I need to show my key to do so (out of all the Wynn bars where I charged drinks to the room, this was the only place to require my room key; of course, no warning of this inconsistency posted anywhere). The key was left in my girlfriend's purse in baggage claim, so we had to go back there and wait in line another 10 minutes to get the bag. Out of frustration, we left after this.\n\nOn the way out, I asked to speak to the manager and was referred to Alfonso, who was socializing with a content group of girls. When he saw that I was waiting to talk to him, he asked what I wanted. I said \"I'd like to talk to you when you have a minute\", in a polite but clearly irritated tone. He told me to wait by a nearby tree. He then walked off with the group of girls and continued their trivial chit-chat (my girlfriend overheard their conversation and confirmed it didn't regard a serious matter whatsoever). After unsuccessfully waiting 15 minutes for their conversation to finish, I finally gave up and left for the European pool.\n\nAll-in-all, I wasted $60 and two hours for the privilege of waiting in countless lines and being treated like a felon. No drinks were ordered, no music was enjoyed, nothing.\n\nI understand that this event was open to non-hotel-guests and it creates the potential for undesirables to enter. However, why create the illusion of exclusivity if you're not actually going to be exclusive?\n\nThe Wynn is supposed to be better than this. Instead of being a follower trying to emulate the Hard Rock Hotel, it should be a creating an experience strictly aimed at its target demographic. Until then, the Beach Club is simply a bastardization of the Wynn brand.","date":"2012-08-27 12:34:39"}

So many places to choose from. The manager and most of the front desk staff at the Hotel I stay at while I'm in Scarborough are Desi, so I ask them their opinion. The first time, they steered me to a Hakka place called Tangerine, just a few blocks away, and it was fab. (Q.V. my review here). This time I said I wanted a different place to further my experience of the area. They told me to go here. (Actually right next door to Tangerine).\nCouldn't have been a better tip! \nRan into a Desi family who say they drive a long way from the other side of the city just to come to this place. Nice folks to talk to. I let the Father order for me. What a feed! Had Beef and some Veggie stuff, great Rice and Naan. Fabulous!! Didn't catch the names of the dishes, but it doesn't matter-I asked him to order me a selection that would put the best of the place before me. Sure did!\nDecor? Not much. And you've got to go to the counter to get your food. So what? I'd walk around the block for stuff this good. No booze either. Again, so what?\nThis place is in a strange (at least for my Chicago ass) little shopping area. It kind of looks like if you are not Desi, you might be in the wrong place, if you know what I mean. It ain't like that. Everyone is most friendly. \nGlad for the recommendation, Mr.Manager! Spot on!","date":"2014-09-13 23:51:05"}

This really is a prime example for Kitchen Nightmares. \n\nFirst, the hostess made the mistake of making us stand by the door for 15 minutes after scoffing that we didn't have reservations. She literally acted like she hoped we would just leave. Finally she said, \"well I can sit you at the bar if you want\". Then another 10 minutes to get us menus.\n\nLet's just say, sitting at the bar gave us the extreme look into the kitchen and all it's awfulness. Without seeing \"behind the scenes\" I might have felt more favorable about the restaurant in general.\n\nFirst of all, they had three waitstaff, except there was a guy doing drinks and the blonde lady who was taking orders. Then you have this 15 year old girl (approx.) running around serving all the tables, making all of the salads from scratch, cooking the bread, delivering the bread, fetching refills on drinks, gathering the dirty dishes and bringing them out back and even doing prep work for the cooks. The poor girl was running around like a chicken with her head cut off and didn't even have a frown about it. Nobody else on the staff even cracked a smile, never mind even talked to each other.\n\nI also have to give props to the chef who was very attentive and made sure everyone liked their food. When he made a steak, he made sure it was cooked exactly how they wanted it and refired when necessary. And the food was amazing, so he's got it going on.\n\nUnfortunately, there were a few things. \n\nFirst, the salad bowls are inches from the ground, on the bottom shelf of the prep table. When the girl made a salad, she was pulling it up from the bottom shelf to use the bowl to mix the salad in. Too close to the floor for my taste. Also, all the salads besides Caesar have MOUNDS of Olives in them, so make sure to ask for no olives if you don't like them.\n\nAlso, the lettuce bin is in the drink station, located an inch from the handwashing station. It would be a miracle if spilled drinks and soap didn't get into the lettuce.\n\nThey also use frozen fish. I don't eat fish, but I'm sure people care about this.\n\nHOWEVER, in terms of our food... it was fantastic. I got the Rigatoni Arriabata and it was probably the best I've ever tasted. It's very spicy, but that's just how I like it. My boyfriend got a steak and it was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.\n\nHonestly, the chef and the young girl pretty much ran the restaurant themselves. The blonde just walked around aimlessly and I have no idea what I guy was doing besides giving more dishes to the young girl to bring out back. Maybe he was waiting tables, but I only ever saw him making drinks.\n\nLike I said.. GREAT food but a prime candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Also, I recommend the Caesar Salad. I didn't get it, but the garden salad was full of chopped olives and terrible.","date":"2011-01-17 23:09:07"}

The entire spa is decorated in a beautiful Moroccan style that I loved, complete with a cozy pillow-laden room for lounging and relaxing. I started there before being treated to a wonderful massage, where the therapist offered a few complimentary extras (oils\/aromatherapy options) when she learned it was my birthday!

Below is my letter to the CEO:\n\n05-18-2009\n\nTo whom it may concern, or the CEO of Krispy Kreme\n\nI guess this has to do with my KK story, so KK recently opened a location near my apartment on Indian School Rd. in Phoenix, so I was there at their grand opening & got the GPS unit and the T shirt, & license plate holder & sunscreen & did the treasure hunt & got the years worth of free coffee and 52 weeks of free donuts. So every time I pick up a dozen for myself or someone else I tell them my story about how I camped out in front of the store at 4:30am and drove all over the valley looking for the free donuts and coffee to get all the stuff I got. So it has been great...until recently.\n\nSo I have been going into store #866 which is the store I received all these prizes at and have been getting my free donuts and coffee occasionally and also have talked with several of the store managers who have allowed me to pay the difference between the regular dozen and mixed dozen so I can enjoy all your donuts not just the plain glazed donuts, and I don't mind paying the extra cash out of pocket so I can enjoy all your donuts at a minimal cost, and KK is not taking a total loss on donuts by just giving them to me for free, it was also explained that due to the fact that I might not get a dozen donuts every week, I can get multiple donuts and they will stamp my card accordingly until I get my 52 dozen.\n\nSo the problem that I have had is several of your regular employees specifically Madelena which is the name on my current receipt which I am assuming is the name of the employee I dealt with since she was not wearing a name tag when I went into the store who is there almost every morning early before the manager is there and also this older white women that works with her have made it quite difficult for me to get any donuts at times.  \n\nFirst off stating that they won't let me pay the difference which I have worked out with several managers at this location, stating several different reasons one they can not authorize it if the manager isn't there, secondly the managers that approved that deal supposedly don't work at that location any more, and seemingly any excuse they can think of, even though I have done this at one other location in the valley. \n\nSecondly they are telling me that I can not get more then a dozen donuts at a time, even though I have missed several weeks, because the card says only a dozen per week on it. So if I go in two days in a row and they happen to be there from the day before I was there they will tell me that I can not use the card because I already got my donuts for the week. Which in turn I just drive out of my way to another location, if I really want donuts that day. \n\nIt has turned into quite a hassle with these two individuals, who seem to be on a power trip of some sort, and I feel quite embarrassed when they tell me in front of other customers that I can not use the perks given to me, it tends to be an unnecessary and embarrassing scene.\n\n I don't know what their problem is KK is winning all the way around, if I get a mixed dozen, and get to talk about how great you are to all my friends and colleagues who eat your donuts it is publicity and advertising all year round or at least till I go through my 52 dozen. Plus I pay the extra for the mixed donuts and KK ends up getting money in the till from me at the end of the day. Not everyone enjoys just regular donuts over and over for 52 weeks, and since I AM PAYING for the difference in cost why shouldn't I be able to do this. All I can say is several times, these two particular employees have made it difficult to enjoy my perks that KK has given me. Is there anything that can be done so I can get my donuts and not get hassled every time I go in to this location? \n\nPerry B.\n\nP.S. I emailed this almost two months ago via the contact on the website and never received a response.\n\n\nKrispy Kreme response about a month later:\n\nDear Mr. B\n\nThank you for your email regarding your local Krispy Kreme's promotion.

What I found was a great spot that serves affordable fresh pasta dishes, great service, and nice ambience. If you ever need too carb load before race day Pasta Fresh is solid choice.\n\nI was thinking about doing build your own pasta. The regular pasta dishes caught me attention with interesting combinations and sounded really good. I settle on the East Meets West pasta dish and for my appetizer went with the garlic knots (had too with all the yelp buzz about it). The garlic knots have nothing but more praise on top of all the other yelp compliments. I have had my share of bad ones. The thing that really stands out for me at Pasta Fresh. You can tell the knots were made fresh as soon as you order them. Not overpowering the amount of fresh garlic or overall garlic flavor. It moist, steaming hot in the inside, and the marinara sauce dip it in is solid. Just wish had more but then never would have finish my meal. All your orders comes with bread plate. Caught me by surprise not only bread presentation something see upscale restaurant but the three different spreads (rosemary butter, olive oil, and whipped butter). The pasta dish loved everything about it. I loved the fact not skimpy on portion size from the pasta, protein (in this dish orange beef),  and the vegetables. Yet not over the top that lose the quality of the sauce or the ingredients. The fresh pappardelle was awesome. The orange beef was cooked perfectly, nice subtle orange, and sesame seeds rounded it off well. The sauce more light creamy sauce but one with the roasted peppers, jalapeno, and grilled broccoli. Not only made the pasta dish more hearty but each ingredient brought something too the dish. East Meets West is one dish that would highly recommend! \n\nThe only thing about Pasta Fresh is you might need little patience comes too getting your food. The process making any one of the pasta dishes takes time. My garlic knots my server telling making it fresh so takes  time (but she great making sure know its coming and apologize for the wait). It open kitchen so could see one of the cooks rolling the dough out and cutting each sheet too order that going out. Time consuming but so worth the wait. Open kitchen makes for self entertainment especially if dining alone. They have long bar table that perfect bird eye view too everything that going on in the kitchen. \n\nThe prices are reasonable. It not cheap Olive Garden pasta but upscale pasta with lot of great options. Not overpriced that you would get on the strip and looking for great place take family out pasta night Pasta Fresh is great option. One that I know will come by for any carb loading day.","date":"2014-04-05 00:22:24"}

With their crooked wigs, they lip-synch to pop songs every 5 minutes then go back to dealing your cards. Hilarious. There's a star.

The menu, particularly for an all you can eat sushi restaurant in Calgary, is worth 4 stars; broad and creative. The decor and atmosphere was social and bustling. It's not for intimate and romantic but perfect for a small gathering of talkative people. Most of the food tasted good as well. Here's the reason for the poor rating; we were served three pieces of crab and the first piece, the claw, was bad. We had a child in a high chair that could not get close to the table because of the table's base so we spent too much of the night cleaning up spills that we should have left for our waitress who didn't blink when I told her that I had started into the bad crab meat and was nearly ill on the spot. If I had to guess the reason for her lack of empathy or even interest I would say it was likely a familiar comment, not a new experience for her. Do not bother with the sunomono if you want the actual salad because it lacks noodles but it's served in a pretty dessert glass to make up for it. We paid a little extra for the extended menu and couldn't eat more after the crab - which they didn't even come get immediately or offer new plates so ours no longer smelled bad - but it was worth it (I'm kidding) because the waitress eventually said the management was sorry and would not charge me for my Diet Pepsi. It was flat and our two year olds half glass of apple juice was $3 but my pop - to wash down the turned shellfish - was free. Do we risk going back again? Unsure. One final tidbit. We asked for a different sitting arrangement before we sat down to dinner originally but were told the more accommodating area of the restaurant opens at a later time then where we were sat. Odd. Is this restaurant already to sure of itself to actually care about its patrons? I sure hope not. Calgary already suffers with groceries that are too expensive, trades that couldn't care less, disgruntled employees, a lack of jobs, and a general apathy in customer service.

Was expecting a little attitude given how busy they were, but got none of that. Hostess was very accommodating. They seated us at the kitchen rail and we had great service, along with great cocktails. Big fan of the Joe's Stiffy. Just saying. Was fun to watch the guys cook and the service seemed really well oiled, especially considering they're still really new and they had zero room to move around. \n\nSecond experience was a much more chill Monday happy hour. Sat at the bar. Again, very chill. And wine on tap! Back to the Future on TV! Old school jams on the radio! I could move in here. Bartender checked back enough to be attentive but not so much as to be creepy. A+. Seemed like a lot of people working the floor for such a small place but I bet they are still figuring out what they really need and everyone looked busy so more power to them. \n\nSuggestions for improvement all have to do with the buildout. The big skylight makes it bake in the middle of the building and the AC over the bar cranks the whole time to make up for it. Spacing on the seating could be easily remedied if only it weren't for the big concrete curb in the center under the booths. These are all things that can be fixed with some additional investment, or just left alone and it will be what it will be. Other than those little thing the place feels cozy and funky and fun.

Fellow Yelpers may recall a question I posted in asking where to find a good  charcutuerie in Buffalo.  No one really had what I was looking for - which, thanks to NYC's Eataly, will never be topped.  But, I found a close second at Beaudevin in the Charlotte Airport.  \n\nClean, serene, prompt and tasty.  Well done.","date":"2012-09-21 16:21:15"}

I like sushi in all forms, but my usual mood is \"give me everything you have until I want to die because I am so full of fish.\" These places, I am aware, offer more food of less quantity. Bocho sushi is the opposite; you may not get a ton of food, but the quality is excellent! This spot does not offer all you can eat. I came here for dinner with a friend because we had a $25 off coupon. Due to my normal stance on sushi restaurants, I was pretty sure this would be my one and only time eating here, and I was absolutely wrong! I really enjoyed my meal, and I will definitely be back. \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is a small, hip place with an upstairs loft and downstairs sushi bar. We sat at the bar, but we did walk up to look at the loft - it was enticing, but I wanted some of that real sunshine the downstairs area provided. When you sit at the sushi bar, you can see everything they are doing, which is cool. Unfortunately, when I was there it did not look very organized compared to other sushi bars I have sat at. Also, my waiter did not refill my water for almost half an hour, and it was not a busy day\/time. This led to what might be called a funny mistake, as a random man walked up to us and asked us if the food was up to par. I assumed he was the manager and replied that it was, but I have not gotten any water since we sat down, and he looked very confused! It turned out he was just some creep talking to us. He came by a few more times and asked us about our food, even though he was just a customer, as we were. It was weird, to say the least, but a good story to laugh about! \n\nTHAT FISH THOUGH!! I tried yellowtail first, and I was hooked. Every piece was so buttery and smooth. All together I ordered a Screaming Orgasm, some edamame, two orders of sushi, and a Rainbow Roll. Together it came out to almost double the price I pay for eight times the amount of food at my regular spot. However, this food was at least twice as fresh and amazing, so I'm not mad about it! I ordered the Rainbow Roll specifically because after trying the yellowtail I knew I needed something with a lot of fish on it, minus some of the extreme toppings on other rolls that cover the flavor. I probably won't be a regular, but I will come back for a quick fix when I am craving some buttery amazing sushi\/rolls or maybe on a special occasion when I am looking to up my sushi game. \n\nQuick Summary: Relatively expensive, but the food is bomb.","date":"2016-06-27 17:11:21"}

I really wanted to like this place...\n\nThere were two major problems:\n\n1) Portions\n2) Price\n\nFirst, the portions. Normally at a gourmet burger place, you check your diet at the door and go in expecting a Meal. It's how it should be. Grindhouse doesn't seem to get that. There were four of us, and we all wanted the ostridge burger, but alas, there were only two left! So we had to split 2 ostridge and 2 bison. The 4 burgers came to the table pre-cut and with a large tooth-pick through each half. Imagine this... you could very easily lift the whole half of the burger on the tooth-pick!! Does that sound like a good size burger to you?? While the patties were a touch thicker, they were no bigger around than a burger from McDonald's!\nAlong with the burgers, we ordered sides of poutine. Same problem. Served in a mug that was just over half-full, I was left disappointed.\n\nWhich, of course, brings us to #2: price.\nThat tiny ostridge burger that I described above was $12.50! The cup 'o poutine, $6.00. And the cheddar for the bison burgers, another $2.00!\nIt's important to mention that the taste of everything was quite good. The bison burgers were far better than the ostridge, the poutine was great and their house-gravy is quite interesting, but you need at least double the food to justify the prices.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend Grindhouse as there are just too many better options out there. There are some great elements, but until they adjust either the lack of food or the massive price, it's just not worth the trip.","date":"2010-01-28 02:59:54"}

It's a nice, quiet (depending when you go)  It has one of the best patios ever.\n\nLocation:\nIt's on the Lake next to the Pickering marina, so in the summer you can sit outside at brunch sipping mimosas watching the boats come into the harbour or watch the ducks swim by. Sigh. Heaven.   In the winter and fall you can sit in the lounge area with it's high windows watching the waves.  So relaxing.\n\nVibe:\nIt's a nicer restaurant. Nothing exorbitant price wise but nice. The people that brunch hear look like the country club \/ sailing set. Chinos, golf shirts, cute summer dresses.  No worries, I was wearing jeans and flip flops, the lounge is a bit more casual, and actually cooler. it was all good there.\n\nFood:\nAll seated in the banquet chair hybrid booth we ordered the roasted garlic hummus plate appetizer, the souffle pancake and the fried chicken club to share and (much needed) coffee to drink.\n\nThe coffee came first. It was actually really terrible.  We were there just after the place opened.  The coffee tasted like it had been around for a while.  Who ever made it likes their coffee strong. It certainly was, it punched back pretty hard.\n\nThe Hummus came next. It was in a good looking dish.  It tasted delicious. The dish  hummus was covered in a sprinkling of what looked like cayenne.  That was just the kick that elevate a great dish to fantastic. It came with small rounds of  bread (still  oven warm) cucumber, yellow and green zucchini, pickled beet ( yum) and pickled onion (weird). I would have never paired pickled things with hummus, but I will from now on!  I will get this every time I come.\n\n\nThe Hummus. Cayenne and crispy chickpeas on top. The best dish of the day!!\nNext we waited, and waited.  Then we noticed that everyone who came in after us were getting their food. We hadn't seen each other in a while, we had already cut our hunger with the hummus, so it was all good. We got a refill of strong coffee and waited a bit more. The waitress ( who was so nice by the way) came by with her and the kitchens apologies and said the pancake wasn't coming out like they wanted so it was going to be 7 more minutes.  She put down a plate of bread with butter. Compliments of the kitchen.  um. nice gesture. I mean a free drink would have been way better, but it's all cool.  The bread was nice and warm from the oven, steaming when you ripped it open.  butter melted into it. Kinda hoppy tasking like it was a beer bread. Was delish.\n\nComplimentary bread. Oven warm, couldn't capture the steam rising from it.   Who doesn't like free soft warm bread?\nSo then we waited some more. Seven minutes passed and we still waited some more. We were still catching up so it was all cool. They are lucky we are so easy going, it was now well over an hour wait.\n\nSo the food came.Looked great!!\n\n\nThe pancake looked great. Worth the wait. Housemade obviously. Blueberry Compote, the whipped cream has a slight vanilla flavour, and it was sprinkled with icing sugar. we noticed after that it said there was maple syrup but we never noticed it, actually we talked about asking for some but decided the blueberry and cream were enough\n\nNext we dug into the fried chicken club.  It contained avocado, tomato, an ancho ranch dressing, and friend chicken.  It came with a side of fries.\n\nThis was just okay.  I wouldn't get this again. it was messy and with the tomatoes and sauce, it was really liquidy and it made the inside of the bun really soggy. The fries were absolutely delicious.\n\nSo this was the first time we came for brunch. To be perfectly honest it was disappointing. $15 is definitely too much for a pancake, especially one that was just good. Coffee was bad and the sandwich disappointing. But when we came for lunches and dinners the food was great.   I guess we can say the food is inconsistant.\n\nIll be back because I do like it, and the view is spectacular.  The neighbourhood is wonderful.","date":"2016-07-10 23:24:14"}

But unhealthy as the food may be if eaten on a daily (or even weekly) basis, I don't see much harm in occasionally succumbing to my latent junk food addiction.  Whenever I'm in the mood to throw caution to my waistline while holding tight to my wallet, JITB is invariably the first place that comes to mind--at least so long as it's been a respectable 3+ weeks since my last visit.\n\nSetting aside the broader debate on the extent to which fast food may or may not be to blame for all that is wrong with America today, those of us who do at least occasionally frequent what I like to euphemistically term \"accelerated dining establishments\" are sometimes faced with important choices about where to fill up on empty calories.  For a number of reasons, I think JITB stands above the rest.  First, JITB serves both breakfast and lunch\/dinner at all times, so if you arrive at 11:30 am in search of a breakfast sandwich, you won't be stuck getting a burger instead.  Second, JITB always seems to have new and interesting menu items.  Third, and most importantly, the Ultimate Cheeseburger is always delicious.\n\nAs for this particular location, I've been twice.  Both times, I found the employees to be the friendliest and most courteous I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant (though the people working at the KFC\/A&W location on the corner of Baseline and Central are similarly deserving of praise), and everything I've tried has lived up to my memories of what JITB should taste like.  If at all possible, though, I suggest eating on-site or in the car instead of waiting until you get home, as the food is never quite the same again after those first few minutes pass.","date":"2008-09-11 01:56:30"}

Sadly in comparison, this show really failed to deliver. It picked up toward the end once they switched to a game-style improv show, but even then the talent seemed a bit green still. They have all been through a comedic training program  but it was clear they might not have all been ready to actually perform for a paying audience. The first half-hour was almost painful- I dare say the worst show I've seen-ever-anywhere (sorry :\/). They went on...and on...and on about a jacket and it just was not funny. I have to admit I wondered if they had a few family members in the audience as our table of six just didn't laugh (and we are silly non-serious types). \n\nThe location is cool - down below The Saloon ( stairs in right hand corner) in a low key underground room with plenty of seating offering great views. The audience on a Sunday was expectantly sparse but hey that just meant we got an even better seat!

I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.\n\nThe food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.\n\nNext, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.\n\nThe Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.\n\nOverall, it was a pretty good experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 71%","date":"2011-06-10 14:55:33"}

We loved how the shell stayed crispy for so very long!!! The chips were super thin (the way we like them) and we combined the hot sauce and salsa for an awesome flavor of perfection!!! We ordered our kid a kid cheese crisp and fries. Those fries were super good! Somehow they stayed hot for 15 minutes!\n\nOur server was Eddie!!! OH Eddie, you made our first visit to Blue Agave so special, fun and memorable!!!! YOU are an asset to Blue Agave!!!! \n\nOn Wednesday we arrived for lunch and ordered ground beef enchiladas and the pork burrito. Another AMAZING meal!! The pork burrito stole the spotlight with its massive amounts of huge chunks of fresh and flavorful meat, but the enchiladas were quite yummy too!! We had the rice, pinto beans and black beans. YUM for everything!! But...our service was extremely slow. \n\nOn Thursday we just had to do it again. We ordered the fish tacos. The fish tacos were kind of small, but the flavor of the taco was good. We ordered their famous chimichanga also. It was also stuffed full of huge chunks of meat and the presentation was beautiful (as is all of the food served), but we both agreed we liked the regular burrito better. If you do order the chimi, ask for it extra fried, as I didn't think it was fried long enough. The reason we like the burrito better is that it didn't seem our chimi was crispy enough. If I'm eating a fried burrito (extra fat and calories), I want it crispy! Our server was definitely better than Wednesday. \n\nSo, despite the fact that we thought the fish tacos were small, we LOVED everything so much that we easily give this place FIVE STARS!!!

The pulled pork was tender and the bbq sauce that came on the side added extra saucy goodness. The dinner roll that came with the meal was just ok though. Was kind of hoping for more of a homemade or buttery dinner roll, but it was plain. No big deal cause the bbq is their seller. I really liked the mac and cheese though. It was very cheesy and creamy. So good with the pulled pork. They also had baked beans for the side as an option. It smelled and looked really good, but I had a full plate going on already. Next time I'll give it a try.

I tried the Anise noodles as recommended by our waitress and it was pretty darn yummy! I had that with the summer rolls with peanut sauce on the side, and it was addicting. I was a pig, even for just an hour...I was a pig! And I loved every minute of it. \n\nOh, and just for kicks, my dining partner ordered the shrimp burschetta simply because that's his favorite item to order at Cyclo.

However, I must say that here is something about a small restaurant in frenzy, like what happens to Cyclo on a weekend.

It's like like acquiring a hot commodity and you kinda wanna go \"neener-neener\" to those who stand by  the door and wait their turn while they salivate.\n\nAt any rate, Anise is a good alternative.

And the bubble tea, the interior, and the friendly staff all add to an overall authentic and pleasant Taiwan experience. Highly recommend!\n\nI have been here about four times. I tried the chicken cutlet, braised pork rice, all 3 bento boxes, pig in a blanket, and various tea products. The food was pretty much exactly what you would get from a street stand in Tainan, the historic southern city of Taiwan. I would say the highlights were the braised pork rice and the chicken cutlet. The braised pork was well-marinated with a balanced blend of spice and soy sauce, giving it its irresistible aroma. The amount of fat was just right so that when combined the pork and rice felt smooth without being too greasy. I was genuinely surprised when I saw the chicken cutlet - it was huge! Easily palm-sized, if not more. With its size, it still managed to have proper coating with plenty of crispiness, and a juicy inside that was well-marinated. 10\/10.\n\nAs other reviews already mentioned, tea products were awesome. They make a good combo with the tapioca(bubbles) since the tapioca served are less sweet than what you usually get from elsewhere, and so your tastebuds can really savor the tea without being saturated by sugar.\n\nAside from the food, one can see that a lot of thoughts have been put into the design and decoration of the place. It radiates with that personality and human warmth of a hidden cafe that a traveler would happily stumble upon when exploring the many nameless streets of Taipei. Worth mentioning is that they also play a good mixture of music ranging from renowned singers such as Cheer Chen to up-and-coming indie bands such as \"No Party For Cao Dong\". I enjoyed their selection.\n\nOverall great place. Will go back.\n\nPS: some reviews mentioned the lack of certain kinds of food and long waiting. From what I heard they are tweaking their menu and trying to figure out a way to meet the large demands. Hopefully these problems will be resolved soon. For now I suggest going there a bit early to avoid the line and get everything you want.","date":"2017-10-30 21:05:30"}

I am gluten intolerant. Really! Not the people who just leave out bread and pasta and think gluten isn't in practically every processed food including broth.\n\n2. I am a country girl. I believe people should not be judged by the amount of butter they consume. I believe everything can be made better by being batter dipped and fried. \n\nSo, I moved to PHX from VA in 2015. My hunt began for a decent gluten free bakery. On a Tuesday, I had extra time in the morning so, I consulted with Yelp and decided to give Jewel's a chance.\n\nI hadn't even looked at the menu when I approached the cashier. I was speechless when he told me the entire menu is gluten free. All the cupcakes, brownies... Donuts (and real donuts not cake in the shape of a donut like all the other gluten free donuts I've seen).... All of it Gluten Free. In a rush to decide, when I saw chicken and waffles - I had to give them a try. \n\nHave I mentioned my belief system on everything is better with a batter???? Also, I make some BOMB fried chicken and come from a family who can throw down on some soul food. So, to say my standards are high, is an under statement. \n\nOh... My... God.... Praise the sweet 8 lb 7 oz baby Jesus.... These were the best chicken and waffles I have ever had in my life. Separately, the waffle was light and chewy - just a dream!!!! The chicken had just enough batter and flavor. Then the dish came with two sauces a lemony honey one I dipped the waffle in which had just enough sweetness. Then there was a spicy honey one for the chicken.... Because every southern knows fried chicken and hot sauce are a married couple!!!! An added bonus was the fried Kale that was on top. It added a lovely flavor contrast but didn't take away from the dish.\n\nI also adored the style of the place. Mismatched chairs surrounding tables. The place supports all local suppliers - which I have noticed is rare to find in AZ. I think I have found my new favorite place, I will definitely be back!!!","date":"2015-06-02 17:13:13"}

It's a very casual haunt, where you can grab some morning breakfast or a quick lunch. You'll see all sorts of customers here - from the church crowd to the hungover college kids. The bagel connoisseurs who work at Owen's are very laid back and friendly. Be prepared to chuckle while reading their menu - they have incredibly creative sandwich names like The Mark Cuban and The Tonya Harding Club. \n\nWhile I've tried many delicious bagel sammies here, but I always go back to my old standby - the Banana Surprise. It's a cinnamon raisin bagel, slathered with cream cheese, covered in bananas and a dusting of cinnamon sugar. It's incredible. Husband always orders a Mr. Turkey with egg, also a delicious choice. All the bagels and bagel sandwiches are steamed and that makes them super tasty and chewy. Oh, and their coffee is local, which just makes me love them even more. \n\nHead on over to Owen's for a monstrous steamed bagel sandwich, and if you're not full enough, make sure you grab a cookie on the way out - they are the size of your face and a sugary dream.","date":"2010-06-08 14:29:11"}

Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish\/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).  \nThe food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.","date":"2009-06-09 16:41:33"}

Came in around 2pm on a Saturday. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it was very quiet and kind of had an overall awkward atmosphere - some TV ambient noise or a louder radio may be good here - we could hear everyone chewing and conversations around us - not pleasant. \n\nI'm not sure if Stoke's has undergone new ownership or just gone downhill but for a non-busy afternoon on a Saturday our food was horrible and service was really slow (there were only 4 tables full in the whole place!). Freezer bag french fries that tasted like it...they were cold and soggy while some of them tasted like they maybe had been sitting around somewhere since the start of the day... None of our food was hot (or even tasted that good for that matter). I had the \"Dank\" pressed meatball\/pesto sandwich - meatballs were again clearly from a bag and frozen and hubs had the \"monte cristo\"  - again awful - cold, soggy and just tasted like white bread. Super disappointing. \n\nWe also got a small order of wings - sauce was greasy at best, wings were burnt, dry and over fried, and the \"pretzel bites\" with \"queso\" - the cheese sauce here was probably most disturbing...it was gritty and grainy and tasted like a bad taco. Gross. \n\nWe sadly won't be back.","date":"2017-05-17 15:50:07"}

An Anchor tattoo because I finally got my captains license & so this tattoo was really important to me & I was super stoked to get it. It was also really important that it be perfect exactly how I wanted it & done by someone who had the tattoo style I like. So I went in, talked to Emilliano who is the manager and the best artist they have. I loved his portfolio. I asked him if he would do my tattoo for me & he said yes as long as it was in the next few hours because he had something at 2pm. I left my ID in my hotel room so I got my pricing ($475) let them make copies of part of my ID and I said ok I'm going to Aria to get my birth certificate I'll be right back. They said ok. Nobody asked me for a deposit. Nobody told me that I did not have an official appointment. So I go to Aria get my stuff and come back 20 min later. The girl at the front desk says \"oh hey Hun, would you mind if Travis does your tattoo? Or Nathan?\". I told her no, I didn't want them that's why I asked Emilliano to do it. Not that they aren't good artists, but they're not as good as he is period and their tattoo style isn't what I'm into. This is the most important tattoo on my body I wanted it to be perfect. She then explains to me that while I was gone, some guy came in & asked Emilliano to do a huge piece for him, & so because mine was only a measly $500.00, he scheduled this guy in my time slot & passed me off to Travis. She asked me if I could come tomorrow. I'm leaving tonight so that would be impossible. I asked if he could please do the other people later & they said no, they want my time slot. The girl felt bad & kept apologizing because she knew it was wrong of him to do that & ruin my tattoo, but no apology from Emiliano he didn't give a damn in the first place obviously & even when I was super upset like almost in tears he never said a word to me just avoided eye contact & waited on his new higher paying customer. I asked the people if they could reschedule since they stole my appointment and they said no. Terrible customer service, zero integrity, zero aloha. You guys suck. Thankfully I found a much better artist - Bob Simmons of Pussykat tattoo - who's now doing my tattoo for almost $200 cheaper as he works at a real shop not an overpriced tourist attraction. Thanks a lot Emiliano ! Since you are the management there I think it's safe to say your whole shop is effed.","date":"2016-07-09 19:03:23"}

Well, that time finally came and I stopped in here for a pre-holiday lunch just a few weeks ago.  I have to brag on them, the food is utterly delicious!  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken crepe for lunch, and a First Timer (Nutella with bananas) crepe for dessert.  \n\n(Yes, dessert with lunch.  It was almost Christmas and I was treating myself...  Don't judge!)  \n\nFirstly, let me say that the buffalo chicken crepe was light and airy while the chicken was spicy and savory.  It was complemented by julienned carrots and crumbled blue cheese, which perfected it.  The First Timer dessert crepe was like a warm hazelnut and chocolate banana party wrapped in a pillowy soft crepe; amazingly good.\n\nSecond, while it all tasted fabulous, the food *was* a bit on the high price for a lunch entree, especially considering that the crepes don't come with any kind of side so really all you get for your money is a delicious crepe.  Also it was a little bit slow in coming out, but still so yummy that I'll easily forgive the wait.  (Plus, as another reviewer perfectly stated, \"It's not as though they are looking to dethrone McDonald's\" so keep that in mind when you are waiting for your food...  Quality takes time, right?)\n\nI edited this to add that as far as pricing goes a miniature, mixed green salad served as a side with the savory crepes (with a simple lemon and olive oil dressing) would easily make me feel the value for the price had been leveled out and would cost very little to provide.  \n\nI don't know if my waistline or my wallet can handle visiting the Crepe Bar too frequently, but I'll definitely make it a point to come by as often as the diet and the budget will allow it!","date":"2013-01-09 19:57:05"}

So i search and search on line and finally found the brand and style of tile that i wanted. I actually went to a different tile store down the street from these guys and on the way back decided to stop in. \n\nWell... I was greeted by Kris who was very professional, asked what we were interested in but definitely was not salesy. She gave us a free sample and her card so we  could try it out in our home and some very rough estimates of how much things would cost. She offered to come out and do a free estimate and I accepted.  I did some more window shopping and found an even better version of the tile that I wanted so when she came to do the estimate (on time I might add) I asked if she could get that tile and she said no problem.\n\nShe was VERY patient with me because we should've started the work in March and I kept pushing it out and we finally started at the beginning of  May. But the entire time, she was completely understanding and not pushing to close the deal.\n\nNow, because I have tile that looks like wood I wanted to get the smallest grout line possible,1\/16 of an inch, I was VERY nervous about their ability to get it done right but at some point I needed to bite the bullet. Turns out I was nervous for no reason at all.\n\nMy floors came out ABSOLUTELY amazing. Like better than I could imagine. My floors look like they could be featured on Houzz.com lol.  They sent a VERY professional crew to our home, they showed up on time, explained what they were doing every step of the way, cleaned up at the end of their work day, even worked on Saturdays. It was all around a WONDERFUL experience. Carlos and his crew and PHENOMENAL!

I placed a compliant tonight. I got off of a 16 hour shift at the hospital and I work again in 6 hours I came here because I was tired and just wanted something fast. The issue wasn't the food, the issue was what I got from this location. When I pulled up and order food a guy from first window took my order and was laughing not to sure why. I pulled up and he didn't get my Sandwich so I reorder no issue, after giving him money he gives me change back and tosses it to me. HE DID NOT HAND IT TO he threw it to me, literally change flew everywhere. Then he started laughing. I looked at him and asked him what is so funny? He stopped and just said oh no uh nothing. I left pulled up asked for manager I told her what happen she was surprised she apologized like a great manage hopefully talk to him as well! I also got apology from the second window girl. Never did that guy come up and apologies or anything I had more to say but didn't just took my food and left. He should know people work hard and sometimes have little to none sleep .

I got there around 7 pm last night for a Saturday dinner - it was busy considering that its downtown and the place is new. The first thing I noticed that something was off was that nobody cared to explain how to use the iPad ordering gadget they use on each table when we were seated. I know thatt we live in 21 st century and most of us have smart phones\/gadgets - it will be wise to explain even for 30 secs how it works etch but no one did so I just had to learn it with my group and it was fun - no problem. However, here's the worst part of the experience, the food takes forever to come. Each dish comes in average between 20 to 30 minutes. We were like hungry hyenas fighting for food - service was also subpar - waiters are quite few and some have attitude. I remember even a waiter giving an irritating gesture with his hand for me to wait.\n\nIn short, I will never come back to this place.

Sorry, that goes for all places that serve food.\n\n Shelina M.\nShelina M.\nOwner\nOne hour ago\nBlock & Report Owner\nElizabeth, \nI value your opinion on the matter of pets at restaurants. Now we have a very delicate balance to uphold...legally service animals have to be with the owner inside or out...just pets though are strictly outside. But please don't write us off. We are also hosting music Saturday from 10-12pm if you're interested.\n Elizabeth B.\nElizabeth B.\nPhoenix, AZ\n 10   56\nA moment ago\nShelina, I have attended some of the \"gigs\" outside and really enjoyed them.  I am cynophobic.  I do not believe that pet owners should put me in jeopardy anywhere not just from being mauled but also with all the germs, viruses, and new diseases being out of control I as a human should have as much rights as a dog.  I do not hate dogs or any animal for that matter I do fear them and the so called SERVICE animal routine is  a total crock.  REAL service animals have been trained and are leashed and listen to the masters.  The bogus SERVICE animals that are rowdy, out of control, are not on 6 FOOT LEASHES but the extended ones jeopardize me to being either mauled or infected.  Technically, this Buddy dog and bogus \"SERVICE\" dogs are the establishments responsibility as much as the neglect owners. I can not express to you the many times I have been in a check out line and out of nowhere a dog comes up from behind me and scares the sH*t out of me.  I went into a Century link store last week by Hobby Lobby in the mall and the dog did not even have a leash at all.  The owner told me  the dog is not going to hurt me and I freaked as it was on my leg.  What does it take for pet owners to understand that it is there pet not mine and I want no part of them.  I am not a hater of them I am AFRAID of them and as a human I feel I should  have the right to go out and RELAX with out someone's bogus \"SERVICE DOG'  unnerving me  I honestly hope that both the pet owner and the establishment gets ticketed.  The deficit would be paid in full.  Any animal around ANY PLACE THAT HAS FOOD in my opinion should be closed down by authorities.  So many mauling, so many uncomfortable situations and so many inconsiderate pet owners.  The only reason this is happening is because establishment makes no attempt to distinguish what is legally a SERVICE dog or some idiot pet owner that feels laws do  not apply to them..  If you take your dog to PET places I will not go there as that place is for them and the pet owners.  AS FOR CAFE's or grocery stores or public places where your dog is on my body or near my body or I am with in mauling distance, in my opinion you need to be ticketed or NOT ALLOWED INSIDE.","date":"2018-01-25 19:45:59"}

Except...The macaroni was cooked al dente, which is probably the only positive thing I can say about the plate.\n\nIn terms of presentation, it looked like a mess, as it came in a cardboard box, so the browned cheese was found in lumps here and there instead of covering the pasta\/cheese mix. \n\nIn terms of ingredients, other than the cheddar cheese (I presume) and macaroni, it contained cauliflower and green peas. I'm not sure where they got the idea that cauliflower and green peas would add, in any way, to the classic dish. It might look a little more pleasant, but you know green peas and cauliflower don't taste much right? \n\nWhatever their reason, the Mac N Cheese I had probably tasted as good as the cardboard box that contained it. It lacked so much in flavor that even salt, pepper, and their spicy mayo couldn't save it. For this dish, I'm giving it a generous 2\/5.\n\nHowever, thank the Lord my friends ordered different items on the menu, including a 6$ (so much more affordable) poutine, which was decadent (see Tony Kangrui L's review), but a bit too salty apparently.\n\nWhat they call tater tots is actually breaded (with mashed potato powder, I suspect) mash, heavy on the cheddar, which tasted very nice next to my whole pound of cardboard-style Mac N Cheese, with green peas and cauliflower.\n\nSo taking everything into account, I'll rate this an overall 3\/5. \n\ntl;dr: DONT TAKE THE MAC N CHEESE!!","date":"2015-06-01 05:18:31"}

We complained to the manager after we left and were compensated with some Starwood points but, I just felt like we kept calling to the front desk being like now this is wrong, I think a nice touch would be send up some champagne, send us up some macaroons. Do something. That's customer service.\n\nOverall, the price was great and the Starwood points is always a great addition which is a big selling point for my choice in booking a hotel. However, when I come back I may think twice before committing and may see what deals I can scrounge up at the more intimate places.\n\nJust a heads up: I booked on the Westin website and was charged a foreign transaction fee which, I think if you book via Orbitz or hotels.com you may avoid. Just a heads up!","date":"2013-01-07 17:04:32"}

They come out of a frozen drink machine, not hand made by any bartender! And very sugary with hardly any alcohol in them. Like a 7-11 slurpee! I ended up giving it away to someone in the street! The bummer was it took forever to even FIND the place -- walking in circles for almost an 45 minutes! With Venetian staff having NO clue where it was either. And the security guard had an idea but note: the Food Court (where it is) is NOT the same as restaurant row! So after 45 minutes of walking in circles ALL I wanted in the world was to down a huge margarita and it didn't happen. Next, the service....barely existed. The girls were not exactly friendly or welcoming, it was a bit disorganized and slow. Lastly, and their saving grace to not getting 1 star...is the food was surprisingly pretty good! We got burritos bowls -- one meat and one tofu! That was a plus, being a vegetarian, yay! there was something I could eat. It's NOT Chipotle but the food is good...definitely overpriced tho.

The worst came a few weeks ago when I attended  a friends \"going away\" party. We got in and set a table, the whole nine yards. We all got food but it wasn't until a plate of some sort of fried chicken was delivered to our table that I cringed. Halfway into her bite, a friend noticed a beetle looking bug about the size of a penny in her chicken. She scraped it off thinking there was no way a bug that big could have made it, but alas, it did and she was lucky she didn't bite into it. We showed the waitress who then took the food back. That's it. No apologies, nothing.  We then barely saw her again but when we got our bill.  Upon leaving the 3 of us who had ordered food all felt sick. I spent  the next two days throwing up and so did my boyfriend and a the third person who ordered food. Seeing as how we each only got single drinks, alcohol intoxication was out of the question.  When we got home we realized that not only us, but several others sitting with us had been charged for extra drinks. When I called up to discuss things with the manager, the lady that answered informed me I must be wrong, because that waitress wouldn't deliver us bad food. The manager then said the same thing, denying there could be a bug because he \"inspected\" the kitchen the day before and we must all have gotten sick a different way.  This was followed by 10 minutes of us going back and forth with him saying that he would refund the 5 dollars for the extra drink. No real apologies, or decent customer service. This place is disgusting.","date":"2012-10-17 23:01:16"}

He's very accommodating in that he will put the vehicle up on their lift so you can inspect the undercarriage, but you need to give his guys enough time to finish spot spraying the rusted areas. When my mechanic went to inspect it for me, there were wet spots underneath where they had sprayed undercoating. He was still able to find rusty brackets that had broken off. He brought a couple of pieces out to the lobby to show me. I rolled back to check it out for myself, and even my untrained eyes could see thru the new undercoating that it was in horrible condition. Even after all this discovery, when I talked to Scott about it, he was aloof and still insisted he had others in line to buy it if I didn't. I wasn't about to buy that vehicle. (Side note: While we were in their back area, there was another van that was being picked up by its unsuspecting new owner. My mechanic took a peek under that one, and it was in very similar condition). As we were leaving, John, the buyer for AZ Mobility Center, came out and apologized for the \"unexpected condition\" of the undercarriage and committed to find another van for me.

However, I just went on their website today and saw that the same red 2008 Sienna is back on there (still had the VIN from the CarFax). Too bad their conscience bailed on them so quickly.

It still wouldn't come off.\n\nI ended up peeling off the nail polish one nail at a time, and underneath was a white, sticky mess which wouldn't come off, either.

Replika is owned by a Turkish couple called Ceren and Ozan and they are really nice and happy to answer any of your questions regarding the menu etc. \n\nWhat's so special about Replika is that it serves Turkish food and everything is homemade! The other specialty is their Turkish coffee and they source their coffee beans from a roaster at St Henri. The Turkish coffee comes with a Turkish delight and it's super delicious.

Finding someone to go with me was like pulling teeth - everyone wanted a lighter option, and I can't blame them for that. I ended up booking off 2 hours on a Friday for lunch and found myself a willing partner in crime, and off we went! \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was a really perfect blend between classy and comfortable - after all, I would hate to have to be on my best behavior whilst stuffing my face with meat. The décor was a good match and the spacing of the tables wasn't too tight. \n\nAll meals come with the buffet sides. The buffet sides selection was effectively a full buffet, with proteins, veggies, salads, and dessert. They even did a pretty cool sashimi style (Sweet soy?) cured salmon, which was awesome. Even that alone would be a good time, but for an extra 4-5$, why not get the full rodizio, eh? \n\nThe meat was excellent - my favourite was the parm beef and the garlic beef, followed closely by the lamb. My least favourite were the sausages. Overall though, it was all really really great - service is prompt and the pace is very suitable. \n\nIt was definitely at least a 1.5 hr affair, and I was definitely a bit snoozy when I got back to the office, but for $23, this was awesome! \n\nI'd definitely come again soon - if I can scrounge up another person for a weekday lunch indulgence.","date":"2016-06-27 19:25:32"}

($26 regular tea service, sparkling tea service is $35 with Prosecco) \n\nThe menu has a selection of teas: Earl Grey, BC inspired piney teas, Jasmine and Green teas, I opted for the White Tip Darjeeling which they describe as the \"champagne of black teas\".\n\nAbout 40 minutes after ordering, half of the group's tea arrived.  \nMy tea was one of the last to arrive even though I ordered first.\n\nTea Attempt #1:\nI poured my tea through the filter and it was full of tiny little bits too small for the filter.  I asked for the pot to be replaced.\n\nThe two people sitting around me ordered the same tea at the same time and had no problem.\n\nTea Attempt #2\nAbout 10 minutes later my teapot came back.\nThe lid still had  tiny tea bits on it.  Obviously the same unwashed pot.\nI poured it through the filter, same problem!  I don't think they changed the tea at all.\n\nI called the manager over.  He apologized and took the teapot away again.\n\nTea Attempt #3\nThe manager brings over a new teapot with tea.\nI lift the lid and it's clean.  I peer in at the leaves and they are the right size.  He says the reason my other pot was bad was that the water was too cold (That's a horrible reason).\nI think they just used the end of the package.  \n\nHe started to pour my tea, it poured fine.  I told him to stop pouring so the tea could steep.\n\nHow long does it take to get a cup of tea?  An hour.\n\nFood\n====\nThe food arrived.\nThere aren't side tables, which is a nice-to-have for more space.\n\n* The bread for the salmon and pumpernickel had been re-toasted and was cold and stale.\n* The shrimp and cucumber bite was the best savory item \n* There were a few other sandwich bites that weren't anything really exciting\n\nDesserts\n=======\nThey didn't change our plates.  That really annoyed me.\n\nThe best part of the dessert was the clotted cream.\n\nThe desserts were served on a small 3-tier tower which was cute.\nThere are a few types of mini scones: Currant, orange, plain.\nThey were dry and had been sitting for a while.  We ran out of jam.\nThey didn't check to see if we needed more and we had to ask.\n\nThe best tea pastry was the fruit custard tartlet.  \nThere was a bite of carrot cake, chocolate cake.  \nThe chocolate cake was very dry and made me sad.\n\nUnfortunately, high tea here fell very short of my expectations.\nI might be back for a regular meal, but definitely not for tea.","date":"2011-12-12 02:19:49"}

That being said, I've also enjoyed everything else I've tried, including pasta dishes, salads, tacos, veggie burger, fried ice cream, and several appetizers. Their menu accommodates a wide variety of palates and diets; many items have gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. I'd recommend the crispy tempura avocado tacos for vegans! Their prices are reasonable for the area, food quality, and portions. Their daily specials are fantastic deals (the personal pizzas are only $5 on Sundays)! \n\nMy fiance and I haven't tried a beer we didn't enjoy. I always bring my growler along to bring some home. The growler fills are NOT cheap, but are comparable to other local breweries, restaurants, and grocery stores in the area. The margaritas aren't anything to write home about, but house margaritas are only $3 on Wednesdays, so I still get them periodically. \n\nThey don't take reservations, so I'd avoid prime times on weekends if you don't want to wait at least 20 minutes for a table.

They could opt for more sustainable products in several areas. For example, they use Styrofoam clam-shells for leftovers, small plastic cups for dressings\/dips, and stick straws in most drinks without asking the customers' preference. I do recognize that often the more environmentally friendly route is sometimes more expensive for the business.

Brandi messed up one of our group's order. Instead of apologizing she blamed it on our friend although we heard our friend order correctly. She ordered Buffalo chicken salad with crispy chicken and blue cheese dressing in the side. She got a wrap. To make matters worse Brandi  didn't expedite the order to correct her mistake. When the order was delivered it was incorrect again - this time it was the salad but it wasn't crispy chicken. Brandi felt we were trying to get free food and got extremely defensive. She yelled at the cook for what was obviously her fault. We asked to speak to a manager and were told she wasn't on site but if we left our contact information she would let the manager know. When it came time to pay our bills we noticed that the bills were incorrect. Brandi was pretty rude by that point. I paid with a debit card. I went to the bar to pay since that was where Brandi was hanging out. She rudely asked me what I wanted and I said to pay my bill. She told me to go sit down. I told her I wanted to observe her running my card. I had no confidence that she would run it right.

If you're looking for a good selection of non name brand items with a healthier twist, then this is your grocery store.\n\nYou will only find a few select brands throughout the store & most of the time it's Traders Joe's private label brand. This is a good thing though, as most of the stuff is more unique then you'd find in your large supermarkets, & most of the stuff is a healthier option. The store is relatively small though, so don't expect a huge selection of items, especially in the frozen & chilled sections. But you'll find some unique items here & wonder why you haven't seen these items before.\n\nAnd if you like wine, then you must make a trip here. They have a huge selection of wines, but the main wine attraction is their \"2 buck Chuck\", which is actually $3 here. It's their signature wine & can only be found at Trader Joe's. They have around 4-5 varieties of their signature wine & it has been voted best wine for the price numerous times. I'm not the biggest wine drinker, but $3 for a bottle of good wine!

We stayed at a discounted 'suite' on the 19th floor with a 'mountain view'. The rooms were exceptionally large with a living room + 1\/2 bath and very large bedroom with very-large bath+shower w-seperate toilet area (very nice). \n\n\nNow for the THE NEGATIVE:  Within a few minutes of entering the room we received a knock from housekeeping. The lady entered and began checking the stocking of the mini-bar, then left. Several minutes later another knock and a second woman bruskly stated that she need to \"look at the room\" ... we refused to allow her entry since when asking \"why do you want to come into the room\" she angrily stated that \"I need to check to see who is in the room\" ... we closed the door after a polite refusal (very unpleasant first impression). \n\n Upon examining the interior of the Armoie (closet-cabinets) I discovered old socks and lady's underwear from the prior occupants. It raised our awareness that the \"housekeeping\" was substantially off-it's-game.\n\nLater that first evening, when I stepped into the beautiful shower I quickly reacted to the STEAMING-HOT water ... even when set to the 'cold' setting.  I tried everything to adjust it to temperate, but nothing worked. I went by the front-desk as we went out later that first evening and the kind desk-lady said 'Engineering was notified' she asked if engineering could go into the room that night, and I agreed we would like it corrected that evening. She said that a \"followup\" would be conducted. Upon returning several hours later I found a business card from engineering stating \"call if you still have problems\".  My wife tried to use the shower and again the water quickly became steaming-hot ... showers were not possible because no matter what we did, on the coldest setting the water remained steaming hot. Since it was well into our second day and no \"followup\" had been conducted (they had askied to have my cell-phone # for followup contact), I again notified the desk at checkout. I did not want this problem to result in a child, or other person(s) being caught by suprise and likely being scalded.\n\nIN FAIRNESS:  THE VERY-GOOD ... the front desk personnel and the concierge lady were exceedingly pleasant to deal with ... particularly in comparison to Bellagio, and some of the other *GM stays. The front desk lady offered us a business-card for 2-for-1 drinks on the 64th -FL of Mandalay Bay at 'THE FOUNDATION ROOM' where we decided to have a very pleasant dinner and evening on the patio overlooking the strip ... the waiters and food were really exceptional ... PARTICULARLY THE WAITERS who obviously took a warm and personal pride in the experience they created for all the diners ... a very personal fine dining approach!\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:  Correction of basic room amenities (plumbing) and better housekeeping and staff manners are essential, without stating further.\n.  \nIF THE-HOTEL IS INTERESTED IN HIGH-RATINGS ... they must consider providing a few complimentary coffee pucks for the Keurig Coffee Maker together with a daily paper for the suites, if not the rooms as well.  The Lowe's Resort Hotels provide this, together with fully natural-cotton bathrobes (rather than synthetics ... a picky point here). But, if a hotel aspires to be at the top-of-the-game ... these are the typical amenities provided at truly fine world-class resort hotels.  Also, it would be better to keep the condoms in a discreet location, not on top of the MB-counter with crackers!","date":"2013-05-20 21:39:41"}

I feel that for such a specialized restaurant that boasts so many dishes to be dairy and gluten-free, the entire wait staff should be well-informed about all dishes. After all, a lot of their clientele are likely going to Fern for their alternative menu options. \n\n2) this is perhaps a bit petty, but I find it very polarizing...most of the wait staff had VERY DIRTY HAIR.

Each hotel guest receives a complimentary breakfast voucher good toward $12.50 worth of food excluding alcoholic beverages. It's a great value and very kind of the hotel.\n\nWe just ate dinner here the night we arrived from PHX. Complimentary chips and salsa were served as soon as we sat down. In addition to salsa, they also gave us avocado dip, mole chili, and chili verde. The chili verde was my favorite and chips were bottomless! Moscow Mule was put in its right place as Tranquilo serves it in a tall trim copper cup. Cosmopolitan is a pretty pink in a champagne glass.\n\nTacos are all a la carte. Out of the three my favorite was the beer battered fish. Batter not too thick and it came with a tangy mayo sauce. Carne asada is just okay, with a smokey taste to it. The braised tinga pork was also tasty. Pork was tender and not stuck in the teeth.\n\nFor breakfast, they have a big selection including gringo (regular bacon and egg), chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, French toast. Their coffee is excellent, not the cheap watery stuff from a can. It's a breakfast blend with an aroma. Coffee is always piping hot. \n\n*Gringo Breakfast ($7.5) two eggs any style with choice of bacon or sausage. Bacon is inconsistent between the first morning and the second. Maybe the chef took the day off after being slammed on Fourth of July. The fried potato is diced and sauteed with onion and bell pepper. \n\n*Chilaquiles ($10) is a bit too chili-ish. The sauce is very red and the taste very strong. Diced chicken with two overeasy eggs. It's not my favorite chilaquiles but it's adequate enough.\n\n*Mushroom and Spinach Scramble ($9) is much better than the chilaquiles. Two scrambled eggs tossed with chopped mushroom and spinach.

By the time we were able to grab one of the server, meats were already burnt out.\nThey never bother to replace our grill pan.\nA typical korean restaurant will serve a little dessert at the end of the meal, like they offer side dishes for free, so i expected that. I asked server if we will get some dessert. We were told, yes we can get dessert but we have to pay for it. Wow! Really?? There are dozens of korean restaurants in the GTA area and I've never visited one where i had to pay extra for the dessert! Over all, very pricey place compare to the service you get.

The quality is the best by far and the value is there, too. $9.75 all you can eat lunch with a carving station? Nice! Breakfast is a bit less, dinner a bit more. All are worth the price of admission.\n\nThe Garden Court Buffet is not one of the new fangled high-end buffets that have taken over resorts on the Strip. Rather, it offers a huge variety of decent to above-average food for a very fair price.\n\nThe buffet service line is probably a good 300 feet long, starting with Hawaiian cuisine, followed by Asian, Mexican, fried goodies, a carving station, roasted chicken, veggies, American, Italian, pizza, and a salad bar. Then, there's an enormous dessert island with  similarly vast options.\n\nThe carving station routinely has tasty meats of very good quality. It was brisket and turkey for lunch today and both were moist and delicious. During breakfast hours, the carving station is used to create custom omelets. The guy who juggles the eggs in pans over six burners has been doing it since I was teenager and I came with Mom & Dad. So, 10 years maybe? He's pretty incredible.\n\nService is always good and the staff is quick to provide refills...a big plus in my book.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best values in all of Vegas.

They are also very young and some are good-looking ;) \n\nBut, I felt like I was seated after a very long time. There were quite a few \"closed sections\"..and even after waiting a super long time, they still didn't clean the table well, which was a little gross. \n\nFOOD: 3 - The food was definitely average. I had the truffle fries and the Fireball Whisky Wings. Both of which were served pretty lukewarm, which was not that pleasant. I wanted it to be served hot!!! \n\nTheir system of leaving warm things out is ineffective. It leaves the food way, way too cold for my taste. I would have rather taken my food scalding than barely warm. The food would have been way better if served hot. \n\nThe highlight of the wings was the bleu cheese wasabi dipping sauce. It was a great combination and made the chicken loads better! Truffle fries were good, but nothing to write home about. My parents ordered the burgers, and they are probably the best things on the menu. \n\nIn conclusion, it was just okay.

I had a very positive experience with DAS shipping a car from San Francisco to Denver.  I wasn't on a strict timeline so I was okay with them taking their time getting it to me. \nIt helps if you know the process - they pick up your car and bring it to a shipping yard where it will sit until there are other cars going to your area.  This is how you get a cheaper cost - they aren't going to drive your car only, it just makes sense to have more cars on the truck.  So, it could take a couple days, it could take 2 weeks (Mine sat in SF for 2 weeks).  Once the car arrives in your state\/area, it will again go to another yard.  A tow company brought my car from the yard to my house.  By the time my car was picked up in SF, it arrived 2 days later in Denver.  \nNo problems, no damage...I had a great experience.  I called frequently and they took every call and were very up front with me.  If you're having your car transported and you want a good deal - DAS is the place.

In the genre of budget-priced Mexican food, it's a 5 star.\n\nThe food is SOOOO good!  It is that old school Sonoran style type of Mexican I remember from when I was a kid in Phoenix (60's-70's).  It is simple, generous servings but not monstrously so.  \n\nThe staff are long-term, get to know you types.  They work hard, and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything; even when you pay, they'll take your group's bill and allow you to pay one at a time, so no dealing with a split check a the table.  This is good for groups going out for lunch from work.\n\nIn the early 90's there original location was on 16th St- TINY... and they were renown for their burros.  They are still a mainstay today and if you aren't certain of what to order, get a burrito.  Their tortas are also exceptional.  I am partial to the basic combo plates.\n\nThe drawbacks:  and yes, there are some-  \n\nTIME.  I would go more often, but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent.  Even when we arrive early (for lunch), there can be delays.  I shouldn't be gone for more than an hour for lunch, and have been 90 minutes twice when out at Juan's.  For me, this is a problem.  And even though i really like the wait-staff, i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups.  Maybe understaffed?  I don't know for sure, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nCHIPS.  I like the chips and hot sauce, but don't LOVE them.  They are the old school variety, which are OK but I do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa, and that's not what you'll get here.  You will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips. \n\nIf you  haven't tried Juan's, and you don't have an inflexible schedule, DEFINITELY give them a try.

I've literally never been in a Bank of America in my life. I told the bartender that it was not my card. He looked at me and told me it was my card.\n\nWe went back and forth. I told the bartender, who must of been held back in elementary school reading comprehension, that no, I had not given him a red BoA card. Instead I originally gave him a dark grey Wells Fargo credit card. He looked at me and said no, he received two cards in the past few minutes and of the two this Bank of America card was mine. I told him no, I gave him a Wells Fargo card and he would look at me an accuse me of lying to him. He was so confident in himself that he wouldn't even listen to me. What a joke, I could find a better employee at the homeless shelter.\n\nIt became such a situation that everyone around me at the bar was literally pulling in my favor. The bartender would say, \"no this is your card\". And I, along with half the bar would laugh in his face and deny the absurd claim. Finally this bartender realized his mistake. I don't know if it was divine intervention or an actual self reflection but either way I received my credit card back which was a huge relief.\n\nHowever the story doesn't end there.  I checked my Wells Fargo account soon after this incident. I saw the $12 drink charge, which was expected. However I also saw a $16 charge right next to it!

They walked me through the lengthy process. I thought buying a vehicle through the internet would be scary for an old man like me. They both appeared trustworthy and customer focused. I was very satisfied with the service they provided me. I decided to have the vehicle sent to the local Charlotte Porsche dealership for a 168 point inspection. The inspection identified a few items. The air compressor needed replaced on factory warranty. In addition, they recommended a tune up and new tires. Alex and Justin offered to pay roughly $900 for the tune up and I paid the balance of $695. I thought that was fair. They would not pay anything on the tires but offered them at their price. I purchased the 4 new tires. Alex and I finally agreed on a price acceptable to both parties. It took a couple weeks to receive the car in Northern Virginia due to the Porsche dealership delay in getting the air compressor from Germany. The day has finally arrived. My new Porsche was delivered to my home. My family and I was extremely excited. The vehicle is beautiful. While driving the car the next day the nightmare began. The vehicle had roughly 5,000 more miles than the internet advertisement and what my purchase contract stated. Besides having over 5,000 additional miles on the vehicle the remaining factory warranty was reduced to roughly 2,700 miles. I bought the vehicle believing to have 7,700 miles remaining.This was very concerning and extremely disappointing. The next day after contacting Alex via text he told me this would be dealt with quickly and would get senior management involved. He reported back to me that the person responsible got fat fingers when typing in the mileage and he should of verified the odometer.  I could understand one number mistyped but three numbers were difficult to comprehend. I was asked what would I like them to do to rectify this situation. I told Alex I believe they should reduce the sale price based on 5,000 additional miles and provide me a bumper to bumper extended warranty of 5 years and 100,000 miles. The cost of the extended warranty is approximately $4000. Alex said he will take my request to senior management. I was contacted via telephone by Julian I believe the General Manager. He quickly told me his company has a great customer reputation and the best they would do is take the vehicle back at no cost and pay for the shipping or give me $1000 for the additional miles. I told him that I was not impressed with his opening comments and his offer was unacceptable. I asked how about all the time I spent on this frustrating and disappointing situation. He said he will report that back to the owner. The owner Jeff provided me in an email with the same offer Julian provided. He also told me he will reimburse me for the tires and Porsche inspection. WOW and he thought he was doing me a favor. I would have not purchased the vehicle knowing the correct mileage so I would not have spent any money. He had to legally offer me the option to return the vehicle at no cost due to situation. The owner dropped the ball on accepting responsibility. False advertising and falsifying a contract is not what I call good customer relations and company ethics. To lose the car and not to receive anything for my several hours of time just doesn't seem fair to me.\nNow you make the call.\nJohn M.","date":"2017-10-30 20:36:43"}

We have used them to ship both our vehicles to Hawaii and back and everything went well and without incident. So we decided let's use them to go from California to Florida, NEVER AGAIN!!! I would give them negative stars if I could.\n\nAfter reserving the spots with Bernie Torres (Sales), dropping them off on January 06, for an ETA of January 20 and paying, that is all that went right. 31 days later on February 06 is when they were available in Florida. \n\nBernie was supposed to be available until the vehicles were trailered and customer service takes over. I never spoke with him again after repeated emails and phone calls. I guess he figures the sale is done and why spend any more time on these guys. That's why his manager commented \"This is not the first time he has heard this complaint from customers about Bernie\". Then get rid of him, don't keep the guy around.\n\nSo we move onto contacting customer service as Bernie refuses to call us back. You can reach them, but they are no help as DAS does not provide these gals with real time information to assist you. I lost count how many times I spoke with them, but I do remember that 95% of the information given was wrong. I finally left two messages for a manager and NEVER received a call back.\n\nWe were told they got backed up during the holidays, it's the bad weather, the truck your vehicles were supposed to go on had a safety violation and we are waiting for another truck. To me it sounds like DAS took our money and MANY other's in BAD FAITH knowing they could not meet the timelines. I wonder if they really want to spend the money to defend a class action lawsuit if there was a hungry lawyer available?\n\nOur home goods were picked up by ABF 11 days AFTER we dropped our vehicles with DAS. The home goods arrived within 6 days traveling commercially on the SAME roads and with additional stops to make. KUDOS to ABF and their excellent, timely service. So what's wrong with DAS??? Nothing but excuses and poor service!\n\nWe expected to rent a vehicle on the front end, but not for 17 days on the back end. It's not just the cost of the vehicle, but we kept having to extend, return, and exchange our vehicle as the delivery date was regularly moving further out.\n\nWe go to pick up our vehicles, relieved  that they are finally here. Only to find lots of white animal hair and debris in our car's back seat. Seriously?!  We cleaned, rolled up the windows, and locked the vehicle properly, so somewhere along the line it was obviously left open and some random animal decided to have a sleepover. I notice the seal on the back slider of the truck is sticking out . I further investigate to find out that somewhere between origin and destination it was broken into. Unfortunately the entire rear window assembly needed to be replaced \nat a total cost of $1,196.76 not including the tinting of the new windows. \n\nSo we first file a complaint with customer service and Karen Johnson gets back to us offering a good gesture of $125.00 per vehicle. I ask that she truly consider what's appropriate for our individual losses and not just offer the standard good will. She refused and offered an additional $25.00 for the pet hair and told me to file an insurance claim about the break in. I did file a separate claim, it was approved on Mar 17 with an expected payment arrival 20-30 days out. I just received the check yesterday (58 days) later. What a shocker that they can't keep their agreed upon timelines. And of course the payment is minus $250.00 due to the deductible clause in the contract. The only reason I received the payment is due to several follow ups with Melina Allen who was actually very nice. I eventually contacted her manager Mike Saucedo who was pretty much useless as Melina had already requested a second time to her manager to process and mail the check. Mike also refused to give me any contact information of Senior Management so I could make them aware of our entire ordeal. Mike offered to accept any information I had, yeah like I am going to trust him to pass on these serious complaints to someone who actually cares.\n\nPaid $1620.00 for shipping, $452.39 on destination rental vehicle, $75.00 interior cleaning of car, $250.00 out of pocket for the trucks window damage.\n\nOffered $275.00 total for this entire ridiculous ordeal.\n\nBasically we are out of pocket an extra $502.39 just to get things back to normal, not to mention the loss of the use of our vehicles for an additional 17 days, loss of time, and just pure frustration. \n\nCompanies don't seem to comprehend the power of repeat business, referrals,word of mouth, and social media. DAS will get no more business from us, nor any referrals and we will plug away on all the social media avenues warning potential customers.","date":"2014-05-15 16:51:23"}

No meat. No dairy. No animal products. None.\nIt doesn't matter what you tell them on your form and if you tell them you eat meat- it is all an act to make you guess what youre getting. And at no time will it be meat. They've even said here on responses that they dont offer meat because they find it too easy to guess what it is by eating a piece of chicken or steak. True as that may be- it's dishonest and feels very very misleading as a patron. \nI eat almost entirely vegetarian- and I was still offended. This is a city with a lot of fine dining, some of the best in the world, if people are going to spend that much on a tasting menu- let them know what it may be comprised of (I.e this is a entirely plant based menu) everyone should be aware of that going in. It's dishonest not to and you upset more people after the fact than if you had told the truth.\nI can only imagine the reverse of tricking people into a meal with meat or dairy  and saying \"look how good that was! Look how we've broadened your horizons!\"\nActions like this is what gives a plant based lifestyle and vegans a bad rep.\n\nThe review listed here by a 'Lisa G.' Stating she got steak and fish is a blatant lie. Previously Lisa messaged me asking me to take down my Tip here that stated it was a vegan restaurant. She asked me to because she thought it would scare people away and this could help people be turned on to vegan food not knowing when they go in! furthermore all of her yelp reviews are publicly for vegan food and vegan restaurants and on her profile it says \"i love vegan meals\" and \"meat causes cancer\" this woman didnt eat steak, nor was she served it. Im not sure what her agenda is and if she worked for Blackout but if not they should seriously consider deleting that misleading and dishonest review clearly written to \"trick\" people into going thinking they'll get meat or fish- and there's plenty of proof to call her out. I wouldn't want her review on my page if I were this establishment. Update: worse yet they've commented on it saying thank you to her without addressing the blatant lie in her reviews, which is highly unethical as a business and should be duly noted. They're aware of the fact this woman was never served meat as they say themselves they are a \"vegetable forward\" restaurant and are only helping the idea of 'tricking' people into enjoying plant based food without transparency. \n\nAnyway I digress\nThe experience was fun and unique but in the end the food was Lukewarm to cold, bland and even tasteless and not worth the money in any sense. Our service was wonderful but everything beyond that fell short on food and experience. Furthermore feeling like youve been lied to or tricked is an awful feeling after dropping hundreds of dollars a person- if this restaurant openly avdertised (and I mean publicly) they were vegan I'd respect them and what they were doing a lot more. In fact I would've been more excited had I known before rather than feeling like someone tricked everyone to smuggly say \"see, look how good that vegan meal was!!\" I've heard that since complaints started some waiters tell you at the get go it's vegan- which is better but in my opinion they could do a lot more to advertise this and make sure people knew, and it could in fact help people become more excited. Nowhere on the information about the menus does it say \"all of our menus are plant based\" which is I think misleading and unethical.\nMaybe if they change their business practice and chef I would consider going back, but for now in this town there is too much fine dining (even vegan) to pick from to come here.","date":"2018-01-04 03:10:22"}

My guest got the San Fransisco burrito which was filled with fries, bacon, pico de gallo salsa, and choice of meat. all for $6.95. He said it reminded him of a California burrito. He said the meat was tender and they gave a good portion of meat as well. They offer two kinds of sauces for you to put on your food. A red which was my favorite. It wasn't spicy to me, just a little kick. And a green sauce. This one was not spicy at all. \n\nThe inside was very clean with all tables wiped down and chairs put into their rightful places.

Well, for shame Neal M. let me remedy this directly and I couldn't have picked a much better spot than Bistro 19 to begin my spring reviews.  I was here for dinner on Tuesday of last week with a couple business associates.  I arrived a little after 7 PM to meet Tom and Mike who were seated at the bar enjoying their first cocktail.  The space itself is quite nice and intimate.  However, they seem to use the space well as to make it seem much larger than it's actual I'd guess 1,000 - 1,500 sq. ft dimension.  You enter and are greated by a large bar typcially packed with locals in casual wear and suits alike,  The interior is sparce and minimalist with high ornate ceilings and tables located throughout but not so close as to lack privacy.  The colors are dark deep browns, gold and green.  The tile columns and exposed wine rack are also a nice touch.  The bathroom is located in the back near the kitchen entrance and are large and well designed.  After a cocktail at the bar we make our way to a table in the back with a nice view of the bustling suburban street on a spring weekday.  The server greets us promptly with a big smile and reviews the features while grabbing us all another cocktail.  I'm having dirty martini rocks which are pretty good, however lacking those really big olives that I likeand most often get at steakhouses.  The meal starts with some bread and butter, meh.. then we order a couple of appetizers.  Mike says he really likes the \"pot stickers\", so we try those and then also try the lemon pepper calamari.  The calamari is fine served very lightly breaded with some type of mayo sauce or remoulade.  The pot stickers are also adequate spiced with some type of thai sauce.  We all decide on salads instead of soups and I try the french onion soup, which was very good.  It had a much more layered flavor than many other french onion soups you get in casual spots and was well seasoned with a somehow still crunchy croute and mounds of gruyare.  Tom and Mike tried the soup of the day which was some type of chicken thai soup that also tasted pretty good from the small sampling I had.  It is so true that you can tell a lot about a chef by their soups and this start led me to believe the rest of the meal wouldn't let us down.  Tom and Mike had the chilean sea bass, which was a nice healthy serving of perfectly cooked sweet sea bass with a nice slaw and marinade.  I had the \"steak and cake\" which was their filet (good quality, not prime) cooked perfectly medium rare along with large perfectly cooked asparagus, mashed potatoes (forgettable) and a good crabcake.  The crabcake had almost no filler and was served with a nice mustard sauce.  This crabcake is good and almost in the same league as Andora's or monterey bay's crabcake,,, almost...  We finished by splitting their version of \"bananas foster\",,, it was very good with a flaky crust and homemade whipped cream I'd guess.  Overall this is a very good option with a warm atmosphere and good prospects in my estimation for long term success in this casual fine dining segment.","date":"2009-04-06 20:10:20"}

The dish was executed well but unfortunately slightly cold when it arrived at the table.\n\n3) Lobster Mac & Cheese was very good and not overly rich which I liked. I didn't find the taste of the lobster stood out much in this dish, I didn't really taste it.\n\n4) The Jerk crab and shrimp was a nice starter with crab legs and giant shrimp cooked with cilantro, lime and a nice spice mix.

I called over the waiter and he apologized and replaced it with a 'tea spoon' I'm guessing all of the soup spoons were gone.We also ordered the calamari off the appetizers.

I ordered a Caesar salad which was very dry needed more dressing but the waiter took too long to come by so I just ate it that way. This place was ok.

They are my Go-To recommendation to clients who are contemplating a home purchase AND Ed has done my own personal residence when we built.\n\nI can literally say that Ed has kept my clients from making million dollar mistakes. \n\nWhat you can expect: Ed arrives at the property well in advance to do his thorough & complete walk through the home (inside the attic & on the roof as well -he'll have pictures for you). He tests everything, every outlet, every light switch, the appliances, their installation, everything. After that, I typically arrive with my clients & we WALK THROUGH the home and review all the findings. Ed's great at taking the time to explain what he finds, what's wrong & what's right with the home. I can't tell you how much I've learned over the years. You get to ask all the questions you may have & can reach out later if you come up with new ones.\n\nBefore the day is done, you receive a full Report in PDF format of the condition of the home & also a summary to use in any negotiations that may come up with the seller.\n\nTerri in the office is a great communicator, responsive, on the ball & a pleasure to work with. I really can't say enough about the collective team at Clear View. As long as they are around, they will be my Go To home inspection team.","date":"2018-06-12 15:20:45"}

Enjoyed him a lot then and we were excited we had a chance to see him tonight.\n\nHe has a 4:00p time slot at the new LINQ Hotel and Casino (formerly the Imperial Palace) moving up from his 2:00p show. Opening act for Jeff is a beatbox performer named JayR. As expected he put out a fantastic show performing some crazy stunts with his unicycle, balancing acts, juggling with some dangerous props (meat cleaver, blow torch, bowling ball, etc). We had VIP seats and were just approx 12-ft from the stage. Jeff's show is interactive and had audience participation. I was afraid that he would pick on one of us being seated right in front. Well, sure enough my hubby and another gentleman got called on to participate in the unicycle act. Totally hilarious! I was able to catch it all on video.  He handed out free gifts to him and the other participant... free DVD of his show and two complimentary tickets to the High Roller (worth $34.95 on an evening ride, cheaper in the daytime, I think somewhere in the $25 range)! Yay! \n\nThe show is not long, maybe a little over an hour but Jeff will keep you laughing and in awe of his tricks. Go see! After the show he meets his guests in the lobby for a selfie and photo op and autograph! Fantastic performer, this young and handsome man. When he is not at the LINQ he takes his show on the road at corporate events.\n\nReview #0242","date":"2014-11-30 18:07:53"}

At least the food tasted real, and not very processed.  As a person who takes healthy food very seriously, this is important to me.  That being said, the Freshii Bowl I ordered was a little heavy on the brown rice, and didn't have enough veggies or protein to be perfect.  All in all, it was good.  It tasted great.\n\nThe problems are twofold.  I was in there for half an hour to forty minutes.  During that time, there were two songs on rotation.  Two songs.  It's enough to drive you insane.  Sure they were decent indie rock tunes but man, I must have heard them each seven or eight times.\n\nThe other problem is their gift cards and their stamp cards.  The stamp cards are only good for a calendar month, so if you are lucky enough to start on the first, and eat there all the time, you might get one (maybe two if you go every other day) loyalty reward meals.  It's hardly worth carrying the card.  Their gift cards expire pretty darn fast too, like 3 months or so.  I had a fifty dollar gift card I almost lost out on.\n\nBut.... at least it's not deep fried or made from mystery meat.","date":"2011-02-16 02:44:15"}

Conveniently for Maid Affordable, they're saying they do not have me on the calendar. And since I called to schedule the appointment, I have no proof that I made the call.

My request was something that wasn't on the menu, I wanted to have Keema Chicken.   \n\nso, I called 2 other places before I landed to the India Oven.   The first 2 places I called, both said No, can't make keema chicken because it's not on the menu.   \n\nAnd finally I called India Oven, I asked the same question, he said \"No problem, we can make Keema chicken for you\"   \n\nThat's the attitude!   Keema chicken normally is NOT on the menu at many Indian restaurants.  It is because Keema(means ground\/minced) chicken is more like home cooking and not really the type of food that the restaurants serves. (I don't know why they shouldn't!) \n\nAs I eat alots of Indian food and know exactly what I wanted to eat, I didn't even check the menu.  I ordered Keema chicken, Plain Naan, Rice, Papadums and Raita. \n\nTheir Keema chicken was good.  A lots of ginger as I expected.  Exactly what I had in mind.  I wish they put green pees but was not a big deal. \nPapadum was spicy and crispy.  I ordered extra so that I can snack tomorrow night!!   \n\nNaan was great, fresh and chewy. Just as Naan bread should taste.  I stick with plain, I don't like those Garlic and the other flavor ones because I want to taste the floury doughy Naan.  It was really good.  I only wish if they didn't use so much oil when they bake the Naans but not a big deal, I liked it alot.  Like I said in beginning, There are better Indians all over the country and I had a better one before.  \n\nAnywayz, My bottom line is,  If you ask something off the menu and they still accommodate you,  that's right there they earned a good score and  some good reviews.   That's the way a good service supposed to be like. \n\nKudos to them and that's why I give 4 stars.  (I often order something off the menu, there are some restaurant that are happy to do that for you and this place is one of them) \n\nThe interiors\/decor are pretty cheesy typical Indian style.  Almost like decor in 80s. But we all have places to enjoy atmosphere already, this place isn't that kind.  \n\n\nAgain, It is highly recommended.  I would definitely go back.  The staff were all nice and friendly, the owner came out and said hi to me too and I was just a To-Go customer.","date":"2014-07-15 03:38:32"}

After riding by the place, I was a little skeptical, but decided to give it a whirl.  You definitely feel like you've stepped back into the 70's when you enter this place, but I think that's the best part about it.  Waiters are dressed in tuxes and take very good care of you.  They bring you vegetables to build your own salad and they give you enough to make like 4 salads (for just 2 people).  We both got steaks and they were very tender and flavorful.  I got the cheapest steak on the menu and I still have to say that it was a very nice steak.  Steaks run between $20-30 which is not too bad.","date":"2009-08-06 21:23:11"}

So here it goes... \n\nLast week's lunch adventure was going to eat at DeFalco's in Scottsdale (fancy), actually when you walk in it really isn't that fancy.  It is a real authentic deli with a line out the door and people running out with food calling out names. We went around lunchtime so of course it was packed.  I ordered the spinach and cheese arancini (riceballs) and it was so good. It was the size of a baseball nestled in marinara sauce. It was perfectly fried and moist inside. I could not eat the whole thing, I had maybe 4 more bites left but I could feel the heart burn coming- it was my fault for not taking an acid reducer prior to going.   \n\nApparently the food networks Guy Fieri was here filming diners, drive ins and dives so it has to be good right? The people are very friendly and service is quick even though they warn you it will take a while.  Once a table has cleared of customers, someone is out to clean it up within moments so they are always clean.\n\nDid I mention it is grocery store too?  You can buy gelato, different types of cheeses, bread and noodles in every single shape and size. Another plus, they have wine AND you can buy their premade pizza dough for $1.99 that is a steal in my opinion. \nI would love to come back and have some more food. But it would be wise to come alittle bit before the lunch rush.","date":"2013-05-10 17:45:21"}

I drove by about 10 times before trying this place out because it just looked eh, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.\n\n\n1. Jalapeno Burger:\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Jalapeno burger and he said it was outstanding. His hamburger did fall apart on him and he wasn't happy about having half of his meal falling onto the plate as he tried to take a bite. He did say he would come back to watch a game and have a burger so all wasn't lost.\n\n2. Au Poivre:\n\nI ordered the Au Poivre and even though the beef was tasty, there were WAY too many peppercorns throughout the burger. I started picking them out because even though I love peppercorns this was seriously overkill. I'll stay away from this one but it wasn't enough of a deterrent to stop me from coming back. I'll try another burger next time. This is also a burger you need to eat with a fork because it falls apart. I had to ask the waitress for skewers to stick into our burgers to try to hold their shape. They seriously need to rethink the height thing and go for width because their burgers are messy as heck.\n\n3.Truffle Fries:\n\nGot these for FREE during a Yelp checkin. SOOOOO GOOOOD!! Ordering these again for sure.\n\n4. Hand Cut Fries:\n\nHe ordered the normal fries and ate them all. A+ on their French Fry skills.\n\n\nOverall I would go back.

Even with the discount, it's still pretty steep but definitely worth it since you can come early\/stay after your treatment and really make an afternoon of it. I came on a weekday and it was pretty quiet. There were other people, but there are lots of little reading nooks and places to lounge. The service is excellent -- what you would expect from the Four Seasons. I.e. there were staff constantly replacing towels, replenishing supplies, keeping things tidy, etc. Every detail is thought of and you can really relax. \n\nBring your swimsuit -- with a spa treatment you have access to their indoor pool and hot tub. It is shared with the hotel guests and there may be kids running around but it didn't bother me too much. There are plenty of lounge chairs to read or take a nap. In the women's change room, there is another lounge area with 2 kinds of biscotti, apples, tea, and water, plus lots of magazines to peruse. There is a steam room, which was lovely after the massage. Spacious rain showers, a swimsuit spinner, and any toiletries you may need are all there. Also, their robes are sooo soft and comfy!! I didn't want to take it off (you can buy them at the spa boutique if you really want to bring it home). \n\nAs for the service, my massage was great and I have been to a lot of spas in the city. My RMT was Kendall and she was excellent at targeting sore spots and making sure I was comfortable throughout (e.g. adjusting temperature, music). You get to choose from 6 different music options and you can choose your aromatherapy too. You will definitely leave feeling pampered! \n\nThe only downfall is that now I'm totally spoiled and will compare other spas to this one!","date":"2016-07-16 02:34:24"}

He was very personable and made us feel welcome.\n\nTo take a page from Jason L... Bold statement in 3...2...1.... Chapala's is some of the WORST Mexican food I have ever consumed. I may be a Gringo, but my palette is very well versed in Mexican food of every quality.\n\nIt started out like any other night, in decision about what and where to eat. I had brought my wife home her favorite meal of all time, so her input was somewhat tied to how awesome her dinner was. It was all on me.\n\nWe left the house a bit like Crocodile Dundee, just on a drive-about to let my steering wheel and stomach lead the way. \n\nAgain, I have lived on the East side of Vegas off and on for years and years. I have seen Chapala's more times than I can recall. It seemed packed most evenings and weekends, figured it was time to stop in. Pulling into the parking lot, I wondered if they were still open, as it was empty. Never fear, the 'Open' sign was illuminated, time to eat!\n\nWe walked in and were immediately greeted and seated. The tables were all covered in some thick, leather table cloths with trim, paper napkins were folded into little tents and the booths had a similar leather pattern to the table cloth. \n\nPerusing the menu, I admired the width and breadth of their offerings. I had not read reviews, so the only warning I had that their prices were pretty high was the aforementioned leather decor.\n\nOur server came by to take our drink orders and was very friendly. A few moments later a female runner brought out the drinks and seemed very put off by the fact we were there.\n\nChips and salsa were brought out and we dove in to what is usually a much anticipated part of a meal. As others have mentioned, their salsa is garbage. The \"chunky\" salsa is spicy for the sake of being spicy without flavor or good consistency. The other salsa was just like cold, lightly seasoned tomato soup. On a positive note, the chips weren't bad, just yearning for some good salsa to dip them in.\n\nDeciding on a three part combination, I ordered and we waited for the food to come out. It didn't seem to take too long for the soup to come out, I let the wife have it and she only had a couple bites. Normally, she is not as picky as me, except when the food isn't that good.\n\nMy dinner was delivered. At first glance, it looked amazing, tacos, enchilada and rice almost overflowing onto the table. Then, I looked closer. The taco shells were Taco Bell, from a box, hard shell tacos. Seriously? You ask us to pay this much for premade taco shells? Then I took a bite and was again disappointed and shocked. Yet another Mexican restaurant using canned chicken. No joke, go to the grocery store, next to the tuna, you will see canned chicken. That is what Chapala's uses. Flavorless, dry, a little tough and with that \"fresh from a can pink hue\" that we all love so much. \n\nFortunately, there was enough extra enchilada sauce, I was able to use it like taco sauce to add some moisture to the chicken, to make it tolerable. I finished the tacos and went after the enchilada. While it too had the same from a can chicken, the sauce and melted cheese made it tolerable. Their enchilada sauce was quite delicious.\n\nFor close to $20, I got sub-par, un-fresh, pseudo-Mexican food. Extremely disappointing. There are so many good Mexican places in town that I don't see as busy as this place gets. I don't get it.\n\nAs mentioned before, our server was great, he talked with us some, was very friendly and personable. Also, I ordered an iced tea but didn't need a refill, so he took it off the tab! No reason, just removed it. That was an unexpected surprise when looking at the check.\n\nAlso, the enchilada sauce was very good. So I'll bump them a second star for that. However, if not for the server, 1 star may be a bit much, just for some sauce over canned food.\n\nNext time, I will be going just about anywhere but here.\n\nOne final note, as we were walking out the door, saw they had a flyer posted on the door asking people to review them on a list of review sites. Well, they're getting what they asked for, maybe they should be a bit more careful about that.","date":"2012-12-05 18:07:38"}

I did want to play keno and the one day my food actually came out before the keno lady came around, and the other day was about 20 mins in or we would've played more games.  The food is a bit expensive for breakfast, but the portions are literally huge.   I got a different meal everyday from an omelet with chicken, meatloaf has, and a salad with fried chicken.  The meatloaf hash I liked but didn't love- the meat had a fluffy type texture- not your traditional meatloaf, and had just ok flavor.

The design on the plastic lids was really pretty and nice to look at. Overall, I can't say enough good things about the quality of their drinks. I've been to almost every bubble tea shop in Toronto, and I can say with confidence that they really know their tea and you can really taste the difference.\n\nAs we tried our drinks, we all exclaimed \"wow!\" in unison.

This stuff is good.\n\nThe size of the shop was TINY, so be prepared to go in 3 at a time if you're coming in with a group! But even though it was tiny, they still styled it to look really nice - the entire interior looked like a small wagon cart selling tea. \n\nThe service was lacklustre, as to be expected, ​unfortunately.

If not, go to the Carnival buffet.  That being said, let me proceed with my review of the gluttony I experienced.\n\nFirst off, I love salmon sashimi.  That is probably my favorite dish.  Rio has salmon... TONS OF IT.  I was in salmon heaven, baby!  I always get a plate full of salmon sashimi.  Their sashimi cuts are generous and not thin and stingy like many other places I've been to.  Plus, the salmon tastes fresh, it is possibly some of the best salmon I've had.\n\nThey of course, have other other dishes, which include the lobster, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, prime rib (to name a few).  All are good.  The prime rib here tastes ok, but not as good as the Mandalay Bay one.  Then again, I didn't come here for the prime rib.\n\nTheir dessert bar is smaller than the Bellagio & Wynn buffets, but it is suffice.  After swallowing everything in my path, there is hardly any room for desserts.\n\nThe price is slightly lower than Bellagio & Wynn, so it's a bit on the pricy side.  As with other hotels, if you have the Platinum or Diamond players cards, you shoot to the front of the line and get a table right away... woo hoo!","date":"2007-06-08 21:07:42"}

Good, open ambiance, and a great environment for a quick meal, takeout or a meetup with friends.\n\nThe biriyani bowls are made with a breaded shell like a pot pie.

It was a first for me to eat a kimchi tofu dish, too. I ordered the been, pork, kimchi soup, number #3. It came with purple rice in stone pot, the condiments like cabbage kimchi, bean sprouts, radish, and some beans. One cup of hot tea came with the meal, of course. Came out to an even $9. \n\nI didn't even know where to eat the dish (i.e., eat inside the rice bowl or the kimchi soup bowl). I told the server about my silly lack of experience, and she chuckled but helped me at the same time. She actually cracked the egg for me and stirred it into the soup. It was still bubbling hot when the egg got added to the mix. Yummy! The sound is so much better than \"snap  crackle pop\" from you-know- what cereal. \n\nI never cared about the presentation of the meal, when there's no need for it. It was kimchi pot, and that's what it looked like. I always thought that these dishes were spicy, well, from the kdrama, that's what I thought. I read that some dishes can be greasy, but mine was not so. I will review again when the opportunity comes. \n\nThe decor is just right. Wooden chairs, utensils in wooden boxes, and I have no complaints. I didn't use the washroom, so I cannot comment on that.

It is known for its consistently good food, superb service and affordable prices. Anne, the manager, can be regularly seen walking for table to table, cheerfully checking on guests, most of whom are regulars.\n\nExcept for some minor price increases over the years, the simple menu has had few changes. All of the standard \"American\" Chinese fare is offered. Both lunch and dinner include your choice of steamed or fried rice AND egg roll, spring roll or chicken wing. Chicken wings are incommonly good and fried golden brown with the perfect crunch. Egg rolls and spring rolls are above average. The usual soups are tasty and, as of my last visit, run less than $2. Unfortunately, brown rice is not on the menu.\n\nPortions are large for lunch or dinner with only a slight up-charge for dinner. The dining room is normally packed but don't let a wait scare you as they do a great job moving diners through. Dining room itself is attractive but showing its age somewhat. Sanitary rating is consistently in the low to mid-90s.\n\nYou can't go wrong here. At the risk of increasing my own waiting time, I highly recommend it!","date":"2016-10-15 15:20:29"}

My current favorite is their Chirashi--thick slices of fresh tuna (I get the big eye tuna) over either brown or white rice. Heavenly! Their Chinese dishes are some of the best Chinese food I've had anywhere. The beef with broccoli is amazing: tender strips of melt-in-your-mouth beef with just enough sauce to flavor the dish but not overwhelm it. The Peking Duck might be the best choice on the menu. The skin is crispy, and although it's very moist it's not a bit greasy. \n\nI hosted a Chinese New Year dinner for my daughter's six friends who are exchange students from China. I ordered take-out from Jimmy Wan's. They each chose food from the menu and we brought it to the house.

I was bedridden for 2 years, incorrectly diagnosed with a myriad of things from traditional doctors. My former physicians had me on mountains of antibiotics which made my symptoms of unexplained neurological problems, excruciating pain, debilitating fatigue, and all-encompassing nausea even worse. The scariest symptom was my loss of brain function. I had memory issues, and trouble speaking or understanding words people were telling me.  \n\nAfter months of researching facilities across the country I chose Sunridge because of how intelligent and caring the Patient Care Rep was. It was there that I received the diagnosis of Chronic Lyme Disease. A diagnosis that over 20+ doctors and specialists had missed over the past 2 years. \n\nDr. Franco is incredibly well versed in chronic disease and was able to clearly explain what was going wrong with my body and how he would help me. He sat with me and my boyfriend for over an hour and a half, taking time from his busy day to make me feel at home in the facility. I've never had a physician do this, to take more than 15 minutes to ask poignant questions, show his level of expertise, and make me feel comfortable and cared for. This level of kindness didn't stop after the first meeting. He continued to check in with me throughout the year of treatments, answering questions, editing my protocol, and gauging my improvements.\n\nThe clinic is stunning and clean as a whistle. The staff are so kind and become like family. Sunridge uses the most current alternative treatments and natural healing protocols which put me at ease after dealing with so many uninformed traditional doctors. \n\nAs each month passed I saw myself improving. My symptoms were being eliminated left and right. My brain function had returned and I was quicker and had a better memory than ever before. The pain that made it impossible to function was gone. It was the blessing I had been praying for. \n\nAnd I'm not the only one who received a miracle after attending Sunridge. Each time I visited the facility for treatments I met another person who was improving day by day. I saw cancer patients that reached remission with the help of Dr. Franco. I've seen people with chronic illness's that were in wheelchairs, being able to walk after a month of IV's. \n\nSunridge Medical brought me the health that I had only dreamed of. Before attending the clinic I had all but given up hope. I am so incredibly thankful for the gift of wellness I received thanks to them.","date":"2015-02-25 19:07:12"}

Personally I do not enjoy local micro breweries. It seems like the U.S. Just figured out that you can add actual flavor to beers, and brew masters are going overboard . \n\nThe RRBC is a fun local brewery with a great menu and experienced staff . ( the high school hostesses can be bitchy and seem annoyed by customers) . I have been going here a little over three years, and overall it is a fun experience ! \n\nDifferent daily specials are reasonable and well prepared . My favorite specials are the bucket wing night, 5$ pizza, and the 12$ steak and beer night. Also the burgers, soups, appetizers, and dinner plates have never disappointed me . \nThe patio during the summer time is fun, and adds more seating! Definitely anticipate a large crowd during weekend dinner times and any popular sporting events. \n\nLike I said, the beer making is the weakest aspect. It is not bad, but also not good . Hope to see improvements for the future.","date":"2015-06-22 13:20:58"}

I would have an extension cord to ensure computer accessibility, a blanket to ensure warmth and headphones to ensure productivity.  Saxby's have the usual music on but it isn't loud to the phone of headphone use.  There are plenty of tables\/seats (compared to your usually coffee shops) and I found a plugin without a problem.  \n\nI am currently sitting here in a tank top and shorts! It isn't cold at all here; rather very comfortable. (This is the best part for me!)\n\nThe coffee is tasty and my usual three shots of espresso and flavor shot cost less than $2.40 after tax! the flavor shots come in awesome combos like White rabbit (hazelnut and white chocolate) or British Islander (Macadamia nut, white chocolate and toffee nut!) I am totally in love with this place.\n\nUmm..what next...Service is friendly and down to earth. Free internet connection. \n\nThere are conference rooms for rent.  If you wanted to use it, this place charges you $10\/hour.  Kind of steep but the flip side is, the whole amount is returned to you in the form of a credit to purchase anything you want. Ultimately, the service is free since you get that money back.  \n\nKaraoke here on Wednesdays 6-8pm as well... all inclusive coffee shop! \n\nCons: \n  A bit out of the way for those who aren't in this area.  Its right off the 95 and unless you attend Nevada state college or live out in this area, its not a place you would ever pass by.  \n\nAll in all, the only reason why Saxbys didn't get a five star is because the coffee is pretty typical in its flavor.  Not as smooth as Coffee bean.  With that said though, I am sold and will be coming here often.","date":"2011-04-25 21:31:45"}

Alright, it's Friday night, it's the holidays, I get it. While we're waiting, someone slaps a sign up on the door that they are completely out of sirloin due to some kind of delivery issue because of weather. Alright, not their fault, they can't control snow. Get seated and no one shows up to our table for 15 minutes. People seated after us are getting their drink orders and we haven't even had someone say a word to us yet. Someone finally shows up and we order. I notice the price of their prime rib has gone up $5+. Tomatoes in my salad are not ripe yet and rock hard. Food arrives and is completely over-salted. Bathroom was a complete mess with toilet paper all over the floor in and out of the stalls and the trash overflowing with dirty paper towels. Order an alcoholic beverage, it never shows up until we ask the server where it is. Apparently it got lost in the system by the bartender, drink shows up 15 minutes later.\n\nOur server was very nice, which was the saving grace of the evening, but this was the first and last time we'll go to this location, even if it is one of the more convenient ones for us.

Sez you!\n\nI'm sad that Joanne Kates has retired from her column at the Globe and Mail. Next to Rose Reisman, she's been a favourite sly target in my reviews. \n\nShe probably doesn't know that I exist. \n\nI didn't even go to her summer camp as a kid, but her reviews informed my own approach to silly amateurish food writing. \n\nAt her best she was brilliantly descriptive. \n\nAt her worst, she relied too heavily on a few standard tropes: the presumptive superiority of French cuisine; the newbie's appreciation for Asian exoticism; the liberal douching of over-the-top sexual metaphors for food. \n\nI have had some great meals. Apparently, they stimilate different pleasure centres of my brain than Ms. Kates'. \n\nI read her farewell column with bemusement, until she commented on he difficulty that comes with finding new ways to describe sushi. \"Aha\", I thought. \"So we are on the same page\". I have reviewed my share of sushi joints, with more to come; but they tend to pile up in my \"complete your review folder\". It's raw fish-hopefully fresh; rice; seaweed; and occasionally fun deep-fried stuff. \n\nKenkou offers all of these, in varying degrees of execution. It's all fine; designed to be consumed in mass quantities, soyou don't really consider how any one piece tastes. \n\nAll-You-Can Eat sushi is eating, not dining; a robotic process that places filling your belly ahead of savoring each dish. I eat. I taste umami-bomb miso and allegedly spicy ramen. Hot, lightly filled gyoza and cool fish on cool rice. I rely on soy-wasabi sludge for a flavour punch. I don't get sick. That's good enough for me. \n\nThe sole item worth singling out are the Golden Shrimp; tempura shrimp wrapped in sweet potato strings before deep-frying. They alone are enough. \n\nMs. Kates now writes for the Post City chain of papers, from the wilds of Thornhill. \n\nI've already added their website to my favourites list.","date":"2012-05-31 14:05:44"}

The deep fried egg rolls traditionally are rice paper filled with noodles, veggies, and lettuce. This restaurant however, does it the cheap way. They use a different wrap that's not rice paper and fill it with a big piece of meat. It's just a log of sausage. Traditional Vietnamese egg rolls are extremely different and better.

Her husband hadn't gotten around to replacing them in the two or more months they'd been out.  I looked on YouTube to see if it was something she and I could do and after watching about 5 short YouTube videos I decided that we could do it. \n\nShe said she already had the bulbs so I had her stop by my place after work. She popped open the hood and we got started but when we went to put the first bulb in that she had bought at Wal-Mart, it turned out to be the wrong bulb. It was the H11 but she needed the H11B. We jumped in my car and drove down to AutoZone which was just a couple blocks away and looked over their selection. At first they only had one guy behind the counter so we couldn't ask anyone questions because he was busy with customers. Then a second guy came out and took the next customer and a third guy came out and started to help us. We asked if that was the most reasonably-priced both they had and he said it was so we bought two of them at $21.99 each. Without my asking he gave us a 10% discount so they came closer to $20 each which was helpful. I don't know if it was because I was a senior or because we said it was the first time we had been in that store, but it was nice that he offered that. We took the bulbs back, got them installed and I felt better knowing she wasn't driving around with her brights on.  I hate when other people shine their brights in my eyes. Plus now I don't have to worry about her getting a ticket. \n\nThank you to the guys at AutoZone for helping us out and saving us a couple dollars.","date":"2017-03-04 20:13:53"}

Every time I order I am contacted shortly after through the app stating the restaurant needs more time. I don't end up receiving my delivery until 1.5 to 2 hours later.

The food was okay, the service was okay, but they overcharged us for a salad and then the server told us we were not allowed to pay in cash.

We thought that was a weird policy for a small business so the server suggested we talk to the owner.  After paying our bill (as charged without asking for the salad item to be changed) the owner came over.  He started berating us and telling us we didn't know how to read the bill.  He told us they were lying about the no-change policy the server spent 15 talking to us about.  We asked him why he was being so aggressive and he started yelling at us to get out of the restaurant.  He told us he didn't need our business because they are one of the top ten restaurants in Phoenix.  Not even close.","date":"2013-09-05 21:17:58"}

Galicia is famous within Spain for its white wines (Albariño or Ribeiro) and for its seafood. The coast of Galicia is in the Atlantic Ocean, and the seafood is simply amazing.\n\nNow, Casa Galicia tries not only to represent Galicia itself, but the rest of the country as well, that is why the main dish they serve is, of course, paella.\n\nNow, knowing the owner is from Galicia, I obviously had some advantage there when it came to ordering our food. I chose Seafood paella. If someone knows how to do a seafood paella, those are the people from Galicia.\n\nIt serves two people and, listen to this, it includes two appetizers, dessert and coffee, all that for 90$!!!\n\nIn Spain it's quite common to order the \"daily menu\" which basically consist of an appetizer, a main dish, dessert, coffee and drink, for about 8-12 euros. Each restaurant would have two or three options for appetizer and another two or three for the main dish. Oh, yeah, and they change daily, so you can go to the same restaurant every day and yet, eat something different in the daily menu.\n\nCasa Galicia represented that quite well, including appetizer and dessert in the price.\n\nI chose Gazpacho ( cold tomato soup)' and they brought little pieces of fried bread for me to throw into the soup, just like at home!\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy, since it is not a big restaurant. And of course, dinner was accompanied by a flamenco show! My hands were hurting after clapping so much.\n\nI strongly recommend to stop by Casa Galicia if you want to feel like you are in Spain for one night.","date":"2015-09-25 14:35:48"}

We got seated at a booth by the window and our server grabbed our drinks as we looked over the menu.\n\nI decided to go with what I had last time (Chicken and Bacon Alfredo) and my boyfriend went off his usual path of burgers and got the beef dip.\n\nMy pasta was as delicious as I remembered, the beef dip wasn't great.

Um es vorweg auf den Punkt zu bringen: Das Hotel hat den Charme der 90er Jahre. Für mich ist es zu dunkel und zu altmodisch, gar nicht einmal abgewohnt. Genau auf der anderen Seite des Flughafens liegt der Hilton Komplex aus einem Hampton Inn und den Homewood Suites. Ich treffe mich mit meinem Sohn am Flughafen und um alles zu organisieren vor unserer Rundreise habe ich mal ein Suitehotel gebucht. Die Reception ist die eines typischen drei-Sterne-Flughafenhotels. Parken kann man vor dem Hotel for free, Wifi funktioniert manchmal, aber eben manchmal auch nicht.\n\nFlughafenhotel in etwa 10 Kilometer Fahrentfernung (Shuttle kommt auf telefonische Anforderung sehr fix) vom Airport - aber überraschend ruhig. Schlafen kann man hier wirklich gut. Shuttle kommt nach Anruf. Downtown Toronto erreicht man am schnellsten mit dem Zug vom Airport. In Laufweite vom Hotel liegt ein Pub mit allerlei Biermarken und dem typischen Pubfutter.\n\nDer Service ist eher amerikanisch belanglos als kanadisch herzlich, aber gut. Hier am Flughafen herrscht ein Kommen und Gehen und meine Theorie ist ja, dass das die Freundlichkeit des Personals nicht fördert. Aber mal ehrlich: Nach der Desorganisation am Flughafen selber und dem eher nüchternen Empfang im Hotel leiden meine enormen Vorschusslorbeeren zur kanadischen Freundlichkeit schon etwas.\n\nGrösser, als ein Standardzimmer ist die Suite schon. Insgesamt ist alles rechteckig aufgebaut; Kitchenette, Wohn-bzw. Schlafraum und das Bad. Die Küche ist voll ausgestattet, hier kann also nicht nur geschlafen, sondern gewohnt werden. Vielleicht ein guter Platz für Rundreisende, um die Reste an zusammengekauften Lebensmitteln erst zuzubereiten und dann zu essen. Im Zimmer steht dann ein kleiner Esstisch und eine Couch, dann etwas weiter das gemütliche Bett. Daneben ist dann der Eingang zum Bad mit getrenntem Waschbecken- und Toiletten-\/Duschenraum. Ist alles zweckmässig, aber insbesondere hier im 90er Retrostil gehalten - braune Muster und klobige Möbel. Insgesamt geht es aber als fly in\/fly out Base.\n\nDer Preis ist hier am Flughafen nicht günstig, daher würde ich das nächste Mal lieber sehen in die Stadt zu kommen.","date":"2018-09-26 16:36:57"}

Also it would run approximately $3,000.\n\nObviously we called for a second opinion. Elite Pro came to the rescue. I met the owner Ronald to assess the damage and he said the compressor is working but the motherboard is broken. The motherboard is basically the one that's runs the compressor. The problem was that they don't make it anymore but Ronald said he could rebuild a motherboard just by ordering specific parts he needed. Plus he only quoted approximately $800-$900. We gave him the go ahead. \n\nHe rushed the ordering process which took about a week. He came over to our home and somehow put everything all back together in less than 30 minutes.

The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.

For example, our waiter was ready to take our food order before asking us if we cared for anything to drink. When are glasses were empty, he never asked if we cared for another drink. We were never asked if we cared for any wine. We almost had to beg to a drink. Water on the other hand, served by another waiter was always plentiful. It was very strange how disengaged the wait staff were with us. We didn't let it bother us since we were there to enjoy a nice dinner for Valentine's Day.

The seasoning and sauces and flavor were great all around. Absolutely nothing to complain about. Also had a blonde cookie\/brownie thing and that was heavenly.

You never know when you'll get the urge to create that exotic dish, and you certainly don't want to be caught without that vital flavor enhancer.  Your normal salt, pepper, etc...?  Yeah, you can get that at any big box store.  But that exotic chile?  That special blend?  That great pink Himalayan sea salt?  Yeah... that's where Savory Spice Shop comes into play.\n\nIt's probably a good thing I haven't checked it out until now.  Or maybe it's not a good thing... because the amount of different salts, peppers, chiles, spices, and spice blends available is totally awesome!  All of their spices are bottled in-house, and the owners are super-friendly and willing to help you out as much as you desire.  \n\nAn additional plus for you sausage-makers: this is one of the few places in Charlotte where you can get Prague powder #1.  Also for the chile-heads is a decent selection of hot sauces, super-hot chiles, and super-hot chile powders (think bhut jolokia and Trinidad scorpion).\n\nThis place gets an enthusiastic 5-stars from me!

I'm a realist - I know what my hair will do and more importantly, what it won't - so I was looking for someone who could work with color so it would enhance my skin tone and eye color, not magically give me more hair (I have fine hair, which I hate). I also know I'm kind of an oddball, since I can take either cool shades or warm shades. Some people call it a blank slate. I call it boring. So, I was looking for someone to give me some pop but not go too nuts right off the bat *and* not make my hair fall out or dry out.\n\nDeana gets it. As soon as I met her, I could tell that she really knows her stuff and she's serious about it. I told her what I was sort-of thinking (I'm no expert), but also asked her to be totally honest with me in terms of what she recommended. I went from a blah, all-one-shade of blonde that washed me out to this incredible multi-dimensional color that literally sparkled just a little in the sunlight. She's truly an artist, beyond a stylist!\n\nNot only is she really exceptional at what she does, but she's awesome as a person, and she gave great recommendations without pushing products. Plus, she was easy to book an appointment with, and even came in early to accommodate my crazy schedule. I've found my new stylist - I LOVE Deana!","date":"2015-09-10 15:34:13"}

She hands the basket off to some weird guy that just sits in the back eyeing his female staff while they work up front.  He takes the basket and then throws on some fries that had been sitting directly underneath a heat lamp. What I had really meant was for them to cook their food 'made to order'.  What the hell is this place?  \n\nI'll tell you what it isn't.  It is not a restaurant.  It's more like a cafeteria with a bar.

My husband and I brought our 2016 Challenger Hellcat into this location for an alignment and balance of the wheels this past Saturday, August 12th. The car has after market wheels on it, so we've always had a slight pull and shake in the wheel. We thought the alignment and balance would take care of the issue. When they were finished with the car I picked it up and drove it a mile home. Because of rush hour, I was driving very slow. The following day (Sunday) we did a day trip up north and immediately noticed how bad the pulling and steering wheel shake had become. It was so much worse than when I first brought it in. \n\nFirst thing on Monday, August 14th I brought the car back, explained the situation and requested my money back. This was with Dan. He told me that they couldn't get to my car until the next day because they were having new equipment installed. I explained I can't go 2 full days without my vehicle. After I didn't agree with what he wanted to do He became very rude, brushed me off, and stated \"Go talk to him\" referring to Garret. \n\nI then went over the entire situation with Garret and requested a refund due to not only not fixing the issue, but also making the issue worse. Garret requested the chance to make it right and against my better judgement I agreed to it and they had the car for 8 more hours. \n\nWhen Garret called to tell me the vehicle was ready he explained that nothing had changed, they couldn't even get the car back to the condition it was in when I first dropped it off. He did offer to refund my money. \n\nThen come to late Tuesday evening the 15th, my husband came home and noticed scratches on the rims. Identical, circular scratches on all four rims. It was obvious that it was done by a machine in their shop. My husband went to the location and spoke to Dan, Garret, and a woman who came out to see the vehicle. Garret adamantly denied that it happened while the car was on their position. My husband explained that there is no way we could have damaged all 4 wheels at the exact same time in the exact same pattern. Garret then said he would talk to his \"wheel specialist\" and get back to us. \n\nToday, Thursday, August 17th Garret called my husband and again denied responsibility and said their security tapes show no damage. Funny though that they won't show us the security footage. \n\nSo now I have a brand new Challenger Hellcat with less than 8k miles on it, $3k after market wheels that are completely destroyed. \n\nStay away from this place at all costs unless you like shitty work, rude employees, and damaged vehicles.","date":"2017-08-18 00:43:01"}

My 45 min treatment included the following:\n- Cleanse and toner\n- Steam with a light mud mask and light extractions (bonus as I was not expecting this!)\n- Oxygen jet peel treatment itself; this was enjoyable and relaxing and Tatjana does a really good job of taking care of any small drips that are expected from the process as the nozzle gently sprays saline water \n- Mask and finishing serums and creams \nIn terms of results on my skin, I really enjoyed this more as a relaxing facial (I've had microderms, light and medium strength peels) so this treatment is a much gentler treatment meant for sensitive skin so I think this would especially benefit those skin types that can't use more intense alternatives. I also really enjoyed how they managed to make this treatment feel like a \"complete\" facial - I've had microderms in the past that were in and out in about 30 mins so I really loved the fact that I got to enjoy the relaxing part I enjoy about a traditional facial as well as a more technical treatment like the oxygen jet peel.\n\nI will definitely be adding this type of treatment to my rotation (especially in the summer!)","date":"2018-02-03 02:24:56"}

But she likes stuff like bone marrow. \n\nI ordered the Sconnie Burger. I ordered medium well, but not many places ever get it right. This is one of those places. The burger was decent.

It was my 1st visit and likely my last....\nI had been curious about the Center and decided to take advantage of the annual free admission offered by Fry's foods, since the local libraries seem to be out of the Culture Pass for free admission to the Center to attend any time.\nI pre-registered on the website and selected Will Call.  Upon showing up, I was bypassed the long lines by the staff but when I got to the table, they didn't even know how to do Will Call.  I had to tell them my name's on their computer because that's what Will Call is: your name\/info is on the computer.  Duh.  A bearded bespectacled guy in a blue shirt spotted my name on the 'puter and motioned to the blue-shirted gal back to that table to hand me the white wristband as proof of admission.  As I proceeded into the Center, I was fascinated by the interactive scientific workshops in the engaging atmosphere that screamed \"north pole-esque\".  My favorite room was the Freeman Gallery, which was geared more for adults .  It curated vintage Arizona from the past couple centuries up to the 1960s featuring homes built throughout the years and how the building of the authentic pipes, toilets, walls, ceilings had evolved.  It also showcased various ways of how they kept cool in Arizona over the years.  My all-time favorite part of the Gallery was actually the beautiful scaled miniaturized homes from various decades, built by hand that were housed inside each glass.  I bet Mike Brady would proudly gaze at them for hours on end ;)  Most other (free) galleries were geared towards kids.  There were paid-for \/ long-lined showcases such as Zip Bike ride up in the ceiling (with a safety net below it) and a Dorrance Planetarium, but I wasn't interested since I wanted to see how much you could do and enjoy on a freebie only.  They had a cafe (which offered 10% discount if you showed your Fry's VIP shopper card) and a separate concession stand.  And, a gift shop.\nOverall, the couple hours I spent there was worth it only on a free admission.  I give kudos to the artists, builders, creators, photographers, scientists, etc. who donated their \"inventions\" to the Center for us to enjoy ogling over.  I thank Fry's for the generous admission.  However, there were awkward moments besides that Wall Call.  I couldn't tell who working there was staff, \"docent\", or security?  How do I flag who when I needed something?  What did the (too-casual) blue or yellow shirt stood for?  Most working there appeared overwhelmed and under-trained.  They seemed more interested in just walking around or chatting amongst each other, a few gave me empathetic shrugs when I asked if they had a map or brochure or rules or anything that represented the freebie weekend, and they did not interact with the kids & parents associated with the displays so the kids ended up entertaining themselves and barely learning anything science-wise.  And, that creepy man-cave unbathed-looking bearded bespectacled reject of a guy who processed my Will Call accosted me a half-hour later as a lone female of the moment and tried to tell me something.  He appeared rushed.  They usually say something to you if they wanted something from you or if you're doing something wrong, right?  I am hearing-impaired and had no idea what he was saying so I just smiled without interest and walked away.  I may look normal and attractive on the outside but you don't know me.  I could be handicapped or a foreigner and you couldn't tell so he had no business to attempt to talk to me (no, I could tell it wasn't an emergency and I checked around my surroundings to be sure).  I did nothing that warranted special attention.  Or, if he knew I was hearing-impaired, I did not request assistance associated with it.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Happily, no one noticed or cared, so no awkward scenario.  I will also be forwarding this to the administration.\nIn concluding, why isn't it called \"Arizona Science 'Museum'\"?  Oh, I think I got it!\n\nUPDATE: As of today October 9, 2017, I still have yet to hear from an administrator regarding that bespectacled staff member in the blue shirt.  I sent a request on their contact form for the correct e-mail so I could forward that photo of the bespectacled staffer (which you can't do in their contact form).  Since this page is Claimed by the Center and an employee responded to a reviewer in the past, I hope it is a sign that they are reading this and addressing the staff member.  Just so they know, if they don't take action (responding to me or handling that guy), karma will bite them in the arse- and hard!  I will update some more if I hear back eventually...","date":"2017-10-03 22:52:42"}

That commitment probably increases their food costs, but the menu prices are still fair and reasonable, in my opinion. Even better, their customer service is just as good as the food. \n\nOn my recent visit, I called the chef out of the kitchen to give him my compliments. As you would expect, he was very grateful and appreciative. But whereas most chefs would probably just accept the compliment and move on, Chef Josh asked, \"Is there anything we can do better? Do you have any recommendations or suggestions for me or our staff? There's always room for improvement and we're always striving to do better.\" \n\nThe response in my head was, \"Wow.

Vegas being a cigar friendly city has always been a huge draw for us, and the retro Vegas vibe of the Fireside lounge has been one of our regular haunts. We were very disappointed to learn that cigar smoking, as of recent, is no longer allowed in the Fireside Lounge (only low grade tobacco that you inhale through your lungs in the form of a cigarette is allowed). A friend in our party was informed of this after he had already lit up a fine cigar! Given this change in the smoking policy, I'm not sure we (or those we know) will be making a return to visit.

The food was pretty good but the service was mediocre. Yes, I'm aware that they are fairly new but it was very disorganized. At one point me and the lady in line behind us didn't know who should pay the cashier first because some of our order was ready yet some was not and no one was advising us what to do. Awkwardness. Also some of the employees weren't very friendly. When my husband asked for green salsa for our chips and salsa she gave him a bad look and seemed annoyed that she had to go to the green salsa toward the end of the line versus the red salsa in front of her. We didn't appreciate the attitude. \n\nNow for the food. The tortillas were hot and fresh and so were the chips. The steak was a little tough and dry but I did enjoy the chile roast beef. It was super tender, juicy and flavorful. They should've drained it a little better before putting it in the taco though because my taco was drenched, dripping and a little soggy from the juice. The tacos came with rice and beans. The rice was good but the black beans lacked flavor. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good but the service was a turn off.

They had a pretty good menu that had dishes outside of Sweet N Sour Chicken. They actually had some more authentic style dishes including Chow Fun, Mapo Tofu and various seafood dishes. We tried a pretty basic lineup of Mongolian Beef and Emperors Chicken. If you know anything about Chinese food, you're probably familiar with the \"smokey, grilled\" taste that you get from the wok. The beef had this taste. It was authentic. \n\nCheck in with Yelp and they'll give you a free half order of Crab Puffs (5) which were amazing by the way. Such a simple and common dish, but this place had one of the best I've had. \n\nIf you're into vegetables, they have some pretty good selections. They're pretty pricey though (not uncommon at Chinese restaurants). We ordered the seasonal Sauteed Chinese Vegetables; market price was about 10 bucks. Although delicious, the price seemed to bother my carnivorous belly, and I instantly regretted not ordering some Chow Fun noodles instead. \n\nOverall, a great restaurant that is definitely hidden but pretty visible on the internet if you search for good Chinese food!","date":"2018-03-24 02:57:58"}

We purchased a Sienna XLE on August of 2015 days before my birthday. Our sales person at the time is Ryan MacNeil. He found the car we like with all the features we want. ( Blue ray DVD for the kids, leather seats, Blind Spot Monitoring ). \n\nWe walked in without the intention of buying. I was dead set on the Honda Minivan. However, Ryan was no pressure sales kind of guy and let us test the car out. Only thing he did was asking me to give him a chance with the numbers. I'm glad that we did. We spend about an hour and half going back and forth with the numbers. He went above and beyond to get more for my trade.  In the end we got the car at less of a price we were willing to pay. \n\nSince we got the car. We have brought the van back to service 3 times now. They always able to get me in and out. ( didn't leave time for me to enjoy the coffee and donuts they provided ) waiting Area is very comfortable and they even have patio with TVs. The service adviser are always nice. They listen you my complaint about the issue of my car and they fix it right away.\n\nToyota's 2 year maintenance free program is a dream. I have had to pay for any service yet. If they are selling extended one. I'll definitely purchase it.\n\nAll and all, I like the dealerships especially Ryan. It's very simple and no pressure tactic works really well for a car buyer like me. \n\nI wanted to give big thanks to right Toyota and Ryan. \nHopefully we can do business again in the future!","date":"2017-01-03 09:06:36"}

Everything from the  snooty pharmacists and technicians, to the photo shop geeks, and the maniacal eyed makeup lady this drug store chain in the ultimate FAIL. I don't think CVS is any better, but the point is, these big pharmacy companies have replaced decent customer service with bottom lines, turning their stores into mechanical factories that want to get customers in and out as fast as they can. Their slogan is \" Be Well\" and you will almost always hear it from their employees, but it's sort of odd coming from a pharmaceutical distributor who's soul reliance is for you to NOT be well. Furthermore, they pay their beloved employees garbage, are so strict and hard in their employees it seems they took a page right out of the Chinese business ethic...work them to the bone, I've them no leeway, and pay as minimum as possible because hey; these people are desperate for jobs anyway. In closing, I recommend staying away from these large chain pharmacies in favor of grocery store pharmacies where they know you on a first name basis, they are less crowded, and many times just as cheap.","date":"2013-04-14 04:23:17"}

I work in the service industry (I'm a manager actually) and was beyond disappointed in the service here! We sat down on the patio (there were no customers inside and not too busy on the patio) the woman that sat us took our drink order immediately. We then look at the menu, the menu which is VERY different from most restaurants and not a thing was explained to us! We waited SO long for a waitress to come back to take our order that one of us went to go inside to place the order and then the waitress remembered we were her table. I ordered two appetizers because the rest of the menu didn't make any sense to me and the blank stares I got from our waitress made me not want to ask her any more questions than I needed to. We then asked for bread, they told us oh, bread is free and comes with the meal. We responded, ok that's great, we figured we had to order it because we don't have any, may we have some. Our food showed up before the bread finally did. Smh. I then went into the bar to order myself a drink, not wanting to wait for our lovely waitress any longer. I ordered a \"ketel and cranberry\" the bartenders exact words were \"my ketel is stoli, grey goose ect...\" i responded to her, no, I want ketel one. She then responds VERY rudely, yea I get that, I don't have it! Ok, that's fine, you should have just told me that. I'll take goose and cranberry then. Takes her 10 min to make my drink at an empty bar! She gives me the drink and walks away.... umm can I pay? She again beyond rudely, oh, that's all you're going to get from me? I actually laughed and said yes and paid for my $10 drink ($1 per waiting minute) long story short, the service here is the WORST service I have ever experienced. The only reason I gave this place two stars was because they had a really awesome guy out on the patio that had his guitar\nAnd sang, he's also the only reason I didn't leave and speak to a manager on my way out and demand my money back!

I verified that this would be able to be done on time when I called, and I confirmed this with the plumber at the time of the inspection. \n\nFast forward to the end of the week (the day before our counter offer was due), and I still had not received the quote. Keep in mind that this was only a couple items and not some huge commercial project.... I called that morning and spoke with someone at the office and reiterated that our counter offer was due the next day and that I had still not received the quote. I was reassured that I would have it by the end of the day. As the end of the day approached, I still did not have anything, so I called again and was told that they would contact the plumber immediately and get right back to me. Nothing. The next time I called they were gone for the weekend and I was transferred to an \"after hours\" hotline. \n\nNeedless to say I never received the quote and had to submit our counter offer without a quote on the plumbing work that needs to be done. I had a roofer, structural engineer, electrician, and flooring company all perform the same task that was promised by Scottsdale Plumbing Company, and the only one to not deliver was SPC. I definitely would not recommend using their services!","date":"2016-10-16 01:06:50"}

They charged a much fairer price than other shops in the area, the reviews were great, and Carl responded quickly when I messaged on Yelp.\n\nThat first experience was a smooth one, and multiple employees went out of their way to try and help me get my phone mount put on the new road bike (I think it was Carl and Sean). \n\nI was satisfied at this point, and soon I realized I needed a fitting! Again, Carl responded quickly and the prices were fantastic, so I called and booked an appointment with Lifan.\n\nLifan was AMAZING! She took her time, made sure we went through every step, and educated me on so many things that I didn't know about biking (I'm a bit of a newbie). I felt comfortable with her so I asked her a lot of random questions that I probably would have otherwise just Googled, and she was enthusiastic and helpful through the whole process.\n\nI ended up buying a bunch of things (like a tube and bike pump that saved my life less than a few weeks later) that I ordinarily would have just searched on Amazon. However I had such a great experience I really wanted to support the shop, so I shelled out the money! I do not regret it, and as I mentioned above that ended up saving me a huge amount of hassle just a few weeks later :)\n\nThe bike fit is great, although I am having some knee pain and will be going back to have them check it out. Lifan made sure to let me know it's OK to come back in if there are issues, it's included in the price of the fitting. It's common that things don't start bothering or manifesting until you're out on the road for some longer rides. Knowing they have my back and will help me get my fit perfect is just another reason their price is so amazing.\n\nWhile I originally thought they are only mountain bikes, I'm very happy with the whole experience and give kudos to Lifan for being awesome and being so helpful! Definitely is now my go-to shop.","date":"2016-04-12 20:07:20"}

First time was last year when I registered my Nissan Altima with a PA plate. I needed an inspection for the car. They asked for a competitive price (around 60 dollars).  However, they will find something in the car that need to spend money on. At that time, they asked for tire change and minor tweaks (around 200 dollars). It was fine and I was happy about it.\nThis year, my car failed because of a \"hole underneath the passenger seat that is 12in large\". 200 dollars cost of repair. I asked them to hold the repair and I questioned their inspection: How can they find a hole that large that was not seen in the previous inspection and barely used the car (seriously I walk to my work everyday, and uber for outings!).\nOnce I started to question them and I needed a second opinion, they informed me that I need to pay another inspection fees once I return it to them.  As I am being punished for asking another opinion!\nI talked to another body shop for a second opinion. It seemed that a hole in the car floor could cost this money (Pepboys were right about it). However, the hole has to be fixed appropriately (From inside out).\nAfter the second opinion, I thought it was not worth it to take it out of Pepboys, because I'll be losing more money. I asked them to go a head and fix the car if it'll be fixed appropriately (From inside out), we ended the phone call. A half an hour later, Pepboys called again: they will fix it temporarily with a patch. If I need an \"appropriate fix\", It'll be 400 dollar!!! I LOST IT!\n\nThe guys are really nice people, that's the extra star for. They lost my trust for the swinging back and forth, bad communication, poor management and last minute surprises about changing the cost. I'm not an expert in car repair but at least I can get a better explanation about my car status. I felt kind of being used. \n\nMy car was handled by a smaller body shop who communicated with me better. Plus I can feel happy to support local businesses.\n\nI would never go back to Pepboys, at least this branch.\n\nBottom Line:  \"you see Pepboys sign in Shadyside\/Bloomfield, run away!\"","date":"2017-08-08 21:21:27"}

I am glad I finally made the trek on a whim on a Friday night, because it really hit the spot for me. Despite the nondescript outside appearance of a small restaurant in a strip mall, it actually is massive, modern, clean, and well apportioned from a space perspective. Great ambiance - lively but not roaring. The Bathrooms were unexpectedly clean, classy, and well designed decor wise, with soft jazz playing for your while you make room for your next order.\n\nIt was extremely busy. I don't know if I just picked an uncommonly busy Friday to try my luck, but I showed up at 6:10 and wasn't seated until 6:40. The joint was packed despite having a huge number of tables. \n\nLuckily I got a quiet corner booth. Overall the quality of the space is high, and cleanliness standards are well above average. Service was very good. The servers were prompt, checked in on you often, and never messed up an order (which is unheard of for AYCE Sushi, they always forget something). \n\nNow, onto the menu. Regular Dinner ($28) and Deluxe Dinner ($33). The additional items offered on the deluxe menu were not worth the value for me as only one of us would have enjoyed it - the only things that caught my eye on the deluxe menu were the crab legs, oysters, and Tataki. Everything else (beef rolls, for example) I see as low value and not worth it. \n\nThat being said, the regular dinner menu was actually pretty impressive. Of course, my focus was sushi: the rolls are pretty generous with fish content and don't overload on rice, which is a mistake I see at many sushi AYCE. The sushi had a pretty thin cut of fish, which is less desirable, but with Sashimi on the menu, you can make up for that. \n\nThe Sashimi selection was okay, but the sashimi order always arrived dead last after a long delay as compared to everything else. This was a turn off for me, as it was so exaggerated it was clearly an intentional method to ensure that you wouldn't order too much sashimi. So if you go, make it a point to order extra sashimi in your first order, and then expect to have it arrive with everything else you've ordered for your second order. \n\nA few interesting ones that I don't usually see elsewhere: I liked the Salmon Yukke (tartar), and the creamy udon. I would avoid the dim sum as it is mediocre. \n\nOverall very good experience at Oishii - going forward there is absolutely no where else i will go for AYCE Sushi.","date":"2017-10-03 20:42:08"}

He also needs to buy some glass pepper shakers because many Canadians like pepper on their fries and their fish.  Delivering up those tiny tear-packs just doesn't cut it.  To some people, that might be a small thing but not to me. I like my pepper and in quantity. \n\nWhile the portions appear to be large, I found that the Halibut was sliced far too thin and this leads to the fish being dry instead of nice and moist.  Please do not try and fool us this way.  We are not stupid.  Pricing was reasonable and on a par with many other places that specialize in fish and chips.  The chips were obviously hand cut on site and while they were not fantastic, they were cooked properly and I ate them all. \n\nIf I was in the neighbourhood and in the mood for fish and chips, I would return to J's........but I would not drive there specially.","date":"2017-10-26 04:02:29"}

You pay at the front, so you don't have to worry about splitting checks and they have lots of seating with 2 long tables able to accommodate up to 12 each. \n\nThey also have smaller booths around the perimeter of the eating area so smaller groups would be comfortable too.\n\nAs a vegetarian I had the mac and cheese with cole slaw and fries. The fries were super crispy but overall the coke slaw and Mac and cheese by its self were nothing to write home about. I understand this is a fried chicken restaurant, but it was definitely lacking in hearty vegetarian entrees in that they had none, the only entrees I saw were salads.\n\nEveryone else ate the chicken and were very happy with what they had. Apparently the first rule of eating fried chicken is to add honey as was posted on the table.  As such they have 3 types of honey (wildflower, chipotle, and wasabi) and one barbecue (BRBBQ) sauce.  \n\nMy husband got the August sandwich special \"BRFC Red Hot\" which was a double breaded fried cutlet with Sriracha chili sauce, Creamy ranch, and pickled cucumbers. He ate it before I could snap a photo. He said the chicken was juicy and crispy and had delicious flavor. He liked this better than the Blue Ribbon sandwich that he usually gets here. Last weekend all of our friends seemed to enjoy what they had.","date":"2017-08-17 23:09:44"}

First dumb thing I did was get a massage right before my spray tan. A big no-no because of the oils, which I knew deep down but assumed a quick rinse in the shower would cut it. But Kelly being her awesome thorough self wanted to consult with the owner first to make sure this wouldn't be a big waste of money. They determined I may be ok if I scrub really well in the shower, so Kelly waited for me to rinse while a friend scrubbed my back and bum, and we proceeded to give the tan its best shot. She was mega careful in her application as well as explaining how to maximize the tan, which included staying 100% away from water, aka the \"death of the spray tan\", for the next 4 hours. Easy enough, right? Don't go near any water whatsoever, got it. Until of course I decided to drink water out of a bottle with no cap on the couch and proceeded to spill it ALL OVER BOTH LEGS just an hour after she left. I panicked, texted Kelly and she walked me through how to handle it, which was to do nothing different and to see how it looked after I rinsed. She recommended Sally Hansen's airbrush legs product as a back up to fix the streaks and guess what... I didn't end up needing it! Miraculously, the streaks never showed and my tan looks like a million bucks. Do yourselves a favor and give these ladies your business. You will not be disappointed.","date":"2017-07-29 05:10:33"}

This was by FAR the worst rental car experience of my life. The wait was absolutely insane....we waited an hour just to be called up to the counter. Every time a \"prepaid\" customer came in, they got to go ahead of all the people who just had reservations and numbers. People with just reservations were screwed! When we finally made it up to the counter, we found out that they were out of most cars. The horribly rude SALES lady at the counter tried to up-sell us on everything. When we refused all of it, she sort of whispered under her breath, that then we'll be waiting awhile because they don't have any cars. Finally, when I raised my voice, she did say that she had one Prius left, if we wanted that. We snatched it up and left, but not before getting in several arguments with her. She basically threatened us if we didn't buy their insurance. She said that if anything happened to the car, that both of our credit cards would be MAXED out, even if the credit limit was $50,000 on each. She argued with everything we said. She was just horrendous. Why someone like this is in a customer service position (although it sounds like, from other reviewers, that they are trained this way), I'll never understand. This will be my first and last Budget Rental Car experience...and SHAME on Costco Travel for being associated with them. That is not good for their business either! Bottom line, if you want a completely miserable car rental experience...definitely go here. If not...I suggest Enterprise or Hertz...or probably others that I don't know about.","date":"2015-09-25 16:00:44"}

It's relaxed, cozy, friendly. It's family owned and run, with the father and son doing most of things, from what I can tell - and the mother\/girlfriend\/a female person who I've only seen once bringing supplies. \n\nEverything seems like it's homemade with family\/traditional recipes. I pretty much stick to one meal, it's the closest to Korean style bulgogi\/kalbi and is consistently well flavored. \n\nThe only thing I would even remotely offer tips on is the speed of service\/delivery. You are seated (or seat yourself) quickly and usually have a menu\/drinks in a decent amount of time (I am big about the wait time, if you haven't noticed yet from my other reviews). The last time I was in was on my lunch break (as it always is). I ordered my usual meal and my co-worker ordered soup. There were a couple other tables there, but they all already had food. We sat, ordered and got drinks within 5 minutes of arriving. When the food arrived, it was 45 minutes later - so 50 minutes into our 1 hour lunch break - and it takes about 10 minutes for the drive. We had to ask for the check right as our food arrived (I hate rushing this), and explained that it was simply because we had to get back to work. We were 10 minutes late getting back to work. I will still eat here, but I might just have to call ahead first - I can't afford to be late to work because they are on \"Hawaiian time\". \n\nOtherwise, I have no complaints. The food is good, they are the only place where I actually eat the macaroni salad. The rice has always been fresh and the flavors have been great.","date":"2012-04-03 05:28:36"}

Chef Kevin who is in charge, even went out of his way to make my daughter scrambled eggs during dinner. One of the servers at breakfast remembered that our daughter didn't eat any excess sugar, and when one of the cooks wanted to make her a pancake with whipped cream and she told him no, because her parents wouldn't let her eat extra sugar.... this was about four weeks after we had been the first time. The food is excellent, and they have a Great wine selection @ an affordable price.","date":"2017-08-17 21:57:07"}

They are on the lunch menu and you would be crazy not to try them. My only regret is that there are not bigger portions of them on the dinner menu. Even when they were \"picking up pieces\" trying to get everything moving following a morning lock-down due to something going on in the neighborhood, they were calm, courteous, just plain fun, and ready to serve as best they could. One can tell how popular they are with the crowd every evening. Can't find where to post a picture or I'd show you a pic of our final night's dinner there. We had a serious feast and it was all fantastic. It does get a little loud because of the right angles of the room. What's more, it is a GCU run restaurant, meaning the people that serve you are likely students working their way through Bachelor's or Master's degrees in Hospitality and Business that require this as part of their experience. I have yet to meet a one who is not going to be overqualified just about anywhere else. Can't wait until I go down to Phoenix for my last residency. Hoping they took my suggestion for dinner plate Street Tacos to heart.","date":"2017-08-17 23:05:08"}

Seating is open to your preference. Booths are comfy, but limited leg space (tall people problems). The noise level is always calm since it's never packed. Sit on the left side if you want to watch some Tele'Mundo Lol.\nDecorations consist of paintings on walls and some hanging Latin streamers.\n\nAs far as the 4 page menu goes, everything is under $15, there's a wide variety to choose from, and all are very filling. The Fajitas with your choice of any meat always comes out packed with a ton of flavor. I get the shrimp and they never fail to impress this picky gut. Enchilada Style Burritos and Chimichangas are huge! The weird part is, they are the cheapest entrees on the menu too. They do not charge extra if you substitute for steak, only on the shrimp.\nFood doesn't take but 10 minutes to come out, but while you wait, freshly made delicious tortilla chips and salsa are brought out to keep you happy. To tell you the truth, its the biggest reason I keep coming back. :D\nAfter dining in, make sure to stop by next door to their linked bakery for some fresh pastries to take home.

This is understandable because it was on a Friday and shortly after we entered a line of other dog-parents stacked up behind us.  I came prepared, we gave the facility two sheets of paper nicely typed with instructions on how to feed our pooch, her personality, what she likes, what she doesn't like, etc.  No one asked us anything about the dog. They only wanted us to fill out paperwork that asked if she had been to a dog park before and provide them with permission to treat her in case of an emergency and of course, her shot records.  We have used many boarding facilities in the past and I have actually even worked at one for a brief time so we are very accustomed to normal functions at these facilities. \n\nAs I was standing in line signing consent forms, a man took my dog without even letting me say goodbye to her.  I asked if I could see the room she would be staying in and was promptly told \"No\".  They then pointed to the television and said she would be staying in a room that would be available to view by webcam.  I asked, \"What room will she be in?\".  They told me they didn't know.  I handed the lady my paperwork and she told us to have a great trip.  I waited a few seconds before asking her if she needed my dog's food bag, blanket, and toys that was sitting on the ground in front of me.  I would assume since she was staying 2 nights that they were hoping to feed her during her stay.  It was very strange that I had to remind them to TAKE the food and her medicine.  Typically boarding facilities go over feeding instructions to ensure that they will be doing things correctly.  This is especially true when a dog is on medication or has a strict diet.  This wasn't the case for Just Like Home.  No one really cared.  But I did point to the typed out sheet of paper before we were ushered out and told them that ALL OF HER FEEDING instructions were on the paper and that she had to follow her diet.  They took her bag and started checking in the next dog. My fiance and myself walked slowly to our car very hesitant to leave our dog behind.  \n\n3 hours after we left I decided to follow the instructions to log in via my phone to see the live video feed.  I couldn't find my dog.  We watched for 30 minutes and she was nowhere to be seen.  We pulled over our car and called the establishment and asked them which room she was staying in.  Again we were told \"I don't know\".  We asked how we could view our puppy if they didn't know where she would be at and then they said that she was probably just being fed.  The next day we logged on to see our dog in the morning and were unable for over an hour to see her.  At one point we almost thought that the videos were untruthful because our dog was never seen.  Her blanket and toys that we brought were never seen at all during her stay in any of the rooms.  (We still do not know what room she stayed in and highly doubt if the facility staff know either!)\n\n\n It wasn't until the morning we were returning to pick her up that we finally caught a glimpse of her outside.  She was laying down in the sun.  That helped us breathe easier.  But with at least ten other dogs around her it was very strange that we saw no person in the yard with the dogs.  This is dangerous if a dog fight would have broken out.  Dogs need to be supervised in groups at all times to ensure their safety.  When we finally got to boarding facility, we were greeted at the front desk again and told that our dog had a great time.  They constantly referred our female dog as a male.  Even in her write up report she was called a HE over and over.  This reinforces our suspicion that they have no idea what they're doing with these animals.  They don't even know the gender (or care to look at the paperwork to see what it is) of the dogs in their care.  When my dog finally came out, her head was hanging very low.  She was put right into my arms, and she didn't recognize me at all.  Her head just hung low, very sad.  It wasn't until I turned around when she caught the scent of my fiance and \"woke up\".  Her entire underside was very wet and she smelled very bad like urine.  This was surprising because she is a very clean dog and had just been fully groomed and bathed the night before she came to Just Like Home. I had to remind the staff that she should still have food left over to bring home.  All of her food was labeled so that they could know exactly what day and when to give her each portion.  When they finally found her food we noticed there was an odd amount left of it. They were feeding her wrong.  We also noticed that her blanket and toys never left the bag we gave them.  We also had to get her groomed right after leaving the facility because she smelled so awful.  \nThere was just problem after problem. Needless to say, we will never come back.","date":"2014-02-25 01:26:40"}

After watching a lovely show at The Orpheum, we were feeling quite peckish, so we headed over to partake in the discounted delectables that The Arrogant Butcher had to offer.  I also just wanted to eat here because I dig the name Arrogant Butcher. From 3-6 PM they offer appetizers such as pretzels with cheese fondue ($5), fried shrimp with shishito peppers ($8), and artichoke hummus ($8).  They also have a decent selection of mixed drinks, wine, and beer at a reasonable price for happy hour.  We indulged in all the appetizers described above, and left with full and satisfied stomachs.\n\nThe pretzels came in a big basket, and are pretty much like the pretzels you will find at Culinary Dropout.  They are fairly large, doughy nuggets, and go well with the cheese fondue (It tasted like some type of cheddar concoction). The fondue was good, but a little grainy.  The shrimp were nicely cooked, and had a nice tender texture to go with the crunch of the light batter.  The shishito peppers were good as well, and were mild in heat.  The hummus was a very nice presentation, and had a wonderful array of textures and flavors, from the smooth, almost creamy hummus, to the pieces of artichoke, olive, tomato, and sweet red pepper.  The pita bread that was served with it was grilled, with a pillowy center.  \n\nService was decent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Definitely a good spot to eat at if you're in the downtown area.","date":"2013-02-24 01:50:11"}

The menu is totally different--yay--and everything was so interesting we decided to just start out with small plates.  \n\nWe had a smoked blue fish plate, an outstanding crepe stuffed with cauliflower tikki masala, a seafood cazuala, and korean fried chicken.  All fantastic.  My favorite, though, was the side of turnips with a maple sauce and peppers.  So awesome.  We tried two desserts and both were off the charts good. \n\nI've been back 3 times.

The resort is a convenient location in regards to Camelback Mountain and Scottsdale \/ Old Town, etc.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit and had requested we be in the back of the complex based on other reviews, which was a good call - Camelback Road can be quite busy with a lot of road noise. \n\nWhen we arrived, our room wasn't ready yet.  We did arrive around (11am-ish) before the check in time, which is 4pm.  Due to other plans we had, we reluctantly left our bags with the front desk and had to leave.  The woman we checked in with said our bags would be placed in the room once it was ready and they would try and have it available ASAP for us.  We got back to the resort around 4pm, our room was ready and our bags had been delivered. \n\nFirst impression of our room... Eh, decent.  The room was clean, however there was no security chain on the door, no 'do not disturb' sign available, and aside from the heat wave coming through the the black front door, I could actually see daylight through the cracks.  I understand the desert sun does no favors, but maybe black isn't the right color to be used here.  From other Yelp reviews, the bathrooms seemed updated; ours, was not.  Rather old school 2\" square tiles, brass fixtures, and a pull-cord in the shower to keep the hot water running (very camp-ground like).  Again, I understand this is a desert and water is a hot commodity but I would expect this at a much lesser quality motel, and not a 'resort'.  The toilet in the master bathroom also kept running, so we had to shut two doors to completely tune that annoyance out.  We were never informed of maid service either, and didn't really expect it (because of the time share experience) - until we had returned one evening to a note that Karen had attended our room that day...knowing that she was coming would have been nice.  \n\nThe fireplace was nice, though we didn't use it; and the kitchen was very nice including granite countertops. Gorgeous windows so we could see Camelback from our room, and a spacious walkout patio with a sliding door from the living room and master bedroom.  The large flat screen TVs were nice too, thought the channel selection was a bit lacking and confusing at the same time.  \n\nThe grounds...  We walked the kokopeli trail several times, it's a nice walking path around and through the the resort.  There's also a putting range, mini golf, grilling areas, and a labyrinth available. Very nice amenities.  We sat at the pool most mornings too. Pool was nice and clean, but we never really jumped in.  I did notice that most front row lounge chairs were reserved with beach towels. (The rules did state that reserving chairs at the pool was not allowed.) There's a nice fireplace and seating area on the pool deck too, nice touch.  We ate at The Grille once too, pretty decent quesadillas and really good onion rings!\n\nTrip Advisor lists this place a 7 out of 73 resorts.  I would not give it that rating at all.  A nice resort, but there are others out there that I've stayed at I would place much higher than this place.","date":"2016-02-14 00:19:18"}

This spot offers affordable lunch specials that are in big portions - average cost is approximately $10 for a lunch dish. \n\nEvery time I come back to Toronto, I find myself stopping here by myself for lunch on a Friday. I must say, it gets completely packed very quickly during the lunch rush (12pm-2pm). The best time to go is after 2pm to ensure you get a spot and less time spent waiting for your food to come out. \n\nThe service is always friendly and great. Always making sure you are enjoying your meal and re-filling your water. The only issue that made me take a star away is the feeling that they want to get you out of there AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Every time that I've gone there (busy or not), they would put the bill on my table right after I take my first bite. Not a big bothersome for me, but still not the most pleasant feeling of being rushed. \n\nOverall, great location (easy TTC access), great service, and absolutely amazing food.","date":"2014-11-15 01:40:35"}

The bread was very soft and not a disappointment for a bakery like Paradise was.  They had really good iced tea, though I didn't catch the name of the brand.  I prefer the counter service now over having a server, though they lack an organized line or signs as to how their multiple counters work.  Maybe a rope system or something to help when it's busy may guide people where to go?  The only other thing that didn't overwhelm me was the cinnamon roll that I got to go.  It was huge, but wasn't very soft.  Maybe it was because I got it to go and is better fresh in the store.  All in all, the outlets for the computers saved our meeting and the sandwich was delicious.

A nice stroll to McGill University and Gay Village. The whole city of Montreal is within walking distance. We didn't even take the metro once while we were there! Our favorite  neighborhood has definitely got to be Old Montreal and we spent a lot of time there. In addition, there is a convention center which has cheap parking to leave your car if the Westin's parking is too expensive for your liking. To add to the convenience, they even exchange money at their concierge desk. Although they charge a heftier percentage than most money exchange places, it was great to have the convenience of it all.

She did not forget to check back on us in a timely fashion after we said we needed time to look at the menu even though she was pretty swamped with tables.  AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal. \nThe cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee! \nI might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding. \nSo instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food! \nMy GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side...

It's always busy so expect a line and to wait a little bit.\n\n2. Always get the extra soup because it's free and the broth is pretty hearty and warming on a cold wintery night.\n\n3. When you have to choose noodle sizes, the mid-flat or mid-round is the best choice. It holds up well whilst floating in the soup and won't go soggy quickly like the silk or regular noodle thickness.\n\n4. I have never figured out how to really incorporate eating the long unbroken noodles with the hot chili oil at the table. The soup noodles don't really need it though.\n\n5. Always get the extra noodle because it's easy to slurp up that long unbroken strand and suddenly find out you got no more. \n\nLan Zhou has quickly established itself against the competition with their hand-pulled noodles along side the ramen and pho shops along the University-Dundas strip. They don't offer a vast range of soup noodle options but they do each of them well.\n\nDon't need to worry about the decor or the spaciousness of the location, just focus on that steamy bowl of broth when it arrives at your table.","date":"2018-03-05 03:05:39"}

Their Lobster Supper (normally $39) is only $25, and boy is it satisfying and good!\n\nI brought my parents here during their visit to Toronto.  They're used to low-quality American seafood chains, like Red Lobster.  This was a big step.  We generally enjoyed our experience, but there were a few issues:\n\nThe FOOD: First, off the lobster supper rocks.  It is a large whole lobster + mashed potatoes + creamed spinach + bread.  At the $25 special, it's a great deal.  The only issue was that they serve the lobster 100% whole too hot to handle.  We had to send it back to get them to slice it in half and provide some instruction to us newbies.  \n\nWe also had the \n--Lobster Mac & Cheese ($14): incredibly rich, a definite hit\n--Lobster cappuccino ($6): hmm...not sure what they were going for here.  Not much lobster involved.\n\nSuggestion for 2: Order the lobster dinner + one other dish & share.\n\nThe DRINKS: We went for wines over cocktails.  It turned out they were having lots of issues with their on-tap wines.  This really delayed things (we're talking 30+ minutes), and they didn't really offer a very good substitute.  They managed to rustle up some alternative bottles, but didn't offer us the lower prices.  As much trouble as we had here, I honestly might have expected some sort of comp.\n\nI saw the lobster caesar...kind of not my thing.  I like caesars, I like lobster tails, but I'm not sure it enhances either to combine the two...weird.\n\nThe SERVICE: Our server was friendly, but rather harried.  I wouldn't call the service good, nor bad.  We definitely were ignored for quite a while, and there could have been a lot better service with the wine issues.  \n\nOVERALL, I think this is a great place to come for the lobster supper on a Sunday.  I don't think I would pay that much any other day.  The food was quite tasty, but there were definitely a few kinks that kept it away from the 5-star mark.","date":"2014-02-07 19:24:39"}

The two dishes I tried were the Nova Scotia (eggs Benny with smoked salmon and dill) and the Fork Scram ( scrambled egg and smoked salmon on puff pastry). Usually when trying two dishes I find a clear winner and a close runner-up. However, in this case, I'm stumped... Which would I order next time? \n\nThe answer is... I don't know... They were both Soooooo good.\n\nThe Benny was mouthwatering both in looks and taste. The hollandaise sauce had a hint of butteriness and a light zing of lemon. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the English muffin was not tough but melted in my mouth with every forkful. So you'd think it'd be the clear winner. But Lo and behold... Along comes the Fork Scram... The light buttery pastry danced the tango with the fresh salmon and the soft moist scrambled eggs (perfectly cooked of course). The fresh sour cream added a perfect balance and the dill helped fuse the dish to new heights.\n\nSo overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is...you can't go wrong. Your visit to the Good Fork will not be disappointing! Just remember the door is a push not a pull!","date":"2016-07-16 14:36:30"}

No.)\n\nThe rooms, for $170 a night, are nice studio apartments with a couple stairs down into the living area. The desk is great, with in-the-top-surface USB charging ports and power outlets. The internet works. The room service is prompt. When I was here, I could really see how writers used to live in hotels.

They sell gelato, coffees, truffles, chocolate bars, artisan chocolates and sipping chocolates.  However, being a specialty store, the prices are not cheap.\n\nFor 2 green tea chocolate bars, 6 truffles, a large gelato, a small gelato, and a cup of sipping chocolate came up to about $33.  \n\nSeating is limited, so secure a seat first prior to ordering.

They even provided tasting samples and suggestions that helped me understand what the different flavor profiles were. I settled on the combo (2 meat entrees, choice of beans, choice of rice) and chose Pollo Diablo (meat alone), Jen Red Pork (in a quesadilla), jerk fried rice and black beans. All were delicious and the servings generous. I dared not finish my quesadilla for fear the Oompah Loompahs would have to roll my fat ass out the door afterward.\n\nI think there's a bit of a learning curve to eating here, but I enjoyed the unique dining experience. One of the staff even spotted my Chico State shirt and we instantly started chatting, since he was also from my neck of the woods (northern northern California, I like to call it). I learned that next time I'm going with the meat entrees as meat alone (as opposed to in a burrito or quesadilla), since there is more than enough of the sides to fill you up and the extra packaging only serves to mask the unique flavors of their savory meat choices.\n\nI'll make a trip back, but I'm gonna save up some room first.
